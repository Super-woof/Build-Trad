1
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,973
Hello, who is it?

2
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:35,153
Hey Chiharu! I told you not to answer the phone, didn't I?

3
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:38,273
It's Chiharu! Hello! Hello!

4
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:40,733
Hello, you've reached the Shigeno residence.

5
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:44,113
Goro nii-chan!

6
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:50,467
Kyowa Institute University for Girls

7
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:54,203
Kyowa Institute University for Girls

8
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:59,463
Even given the current condition, when we take
the positive law from the ancient times...

9
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:03,383
I have no idea of what he's talking about...

10
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,673
I hope we'll finish a bit early.

11
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:11,013
And there aren't any club activities today... I'm so bored.

12
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:14,393
Really, is there anything you like besides softball?

13
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:17,273
W-What's wrong with that?

14
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,773
Nothing...

15
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:29,533
Hmm, a text from Taiga? That's rare.

16
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:30,493
{\an8}Note: From Taiga, Announcement for Big Sis! Seems like Shigeno returned. I'll let you know even though you are not interested in guys.

17
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:32,300
Once Again

18
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,668
Hey, Kaoru! What's up?

19
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:39,668
Sorry! I'm skipping the next classes!

20
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:46,838
Honda's back!

21
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:56,688
Do your best! And don't you dare forget about
your promise about the first autograph!

22
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:58,848
Yeah!

23
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:10,698
Oh, crap! I forgot to put it in silent mode!

24
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:12,778
Yes, hello?

25
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:13,538
Taiga.

26
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:16,748
Oh, it's you? What's up?

27
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:22,168
Uh, about your text... Is it true that Honda's come back?

28
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:24,628
Yeah, it's true.

29
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:28,678
Apparently he called Professor Yamada
to tell him that he was back in Japan.

30
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:30,798
Oh, I see...

31
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:35,678
Anything else? Did you hear anything about his plans for now?

32
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:41,938
Well, first, he said he will start doing his solo training again soon,
but he said he'll show his face at the baseball club first

33
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:42,768
I see...

34
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:48,148
What's wrong? If you're so interested in what he's
doing, why don't you go directly to his house?

35
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,078
Well, you do want to see him don't you?
So why don't you go right now?

36
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:54,408
T-That...

37
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,118
Why don't you go and kiss him, huh?

38
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,908
That's not it at all!

39
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:10,428
Well, well, she's a bit too old to still be
playing the pure and innocent virgin...

40
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:12,338
Note: Third from top is Shigeno Goro

41
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:22,558
It's somewhat irritating, but I'll give it a try.

42
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,278
<i>I wonder if he's here.</i>

43
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:36,078
<i>Ah no, he just came home today...</i>

44
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,248
<i>It's probably a good idea if I just let him be alone with his family.</i>

45
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:45,208
<i>No, that's no good. I'd better just go home.</i>

46
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,008
<i>Besides, why should I come and meet him?</i>

47
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,758
Oh, it's you Shimizu!

48
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:56,098
Ah, ma'am! I'm sorry I haven't contacted you for so long.

49
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:59,808
It's been a while, yes... So how is it going at the University?

50
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:07,318
Translator's Note: goukons are joint parties between two or more
groups belonging to different universities or companies.

51
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:04,688
Uh... Yes, well... hm, well I'm really into the softball club and
also into goukon, and of course I don't have any boyfriends.

52
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:10,938
I-I didn't need that many details, but...

53
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,828
He's here you know. Goro.

54
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:23,168
He's arrived this morning, so I think he's
still sleeping because of the jet lag.

55
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:26,208
Oh, I see. Then I'll come another time--

56
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,418
Can you wait a moment?

57
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:31,758
I think I can get him out of bed and on his
feet if I tell him that you came to see him.

58
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,338
Ah, no! Don't...

59
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,238
That's strange...

60
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:56,488
I'm sorry, it seems he left without leaving a note.

61
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,078
I wonder where to...

62
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:02,538
And since he just came back, he doesn't have a cell phone yet.

63
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,538
I'm sorry you had to come for nothing.

64
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,128
It's okay. I'll come again.

65
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:15,878
<i>But where did he go?</i>

66
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:21,718
<i>Maybe he went to see Tashiro or Fuji, or even Komori?</i>

67
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:24,388
<i>Maybe he wanted to meet with Toshiya-kun now that he's a pro?</i>

68
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:29,978
<i>In any case, he didn't come to see me.</i>

69
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:44,618
<i>He's not here either.</i>

70
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:51,208
Well, I suppose it was to be expected, now that
he's a pro, he wouldn't want to come here.

71
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,548
Oh? Is that you, Shimizu?

72
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:57,338
Komori!

73
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,348
So Honda-kun's back, huh?

74
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:07,518
Yeah, so I went right over to his place
to meet him, but he wasn't there.

75
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:12,978
I want to see him, too. He's making
quite the triumphant return, huh?

76
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:18,908
If he plays in the Majors next year, I'm
sure he'll become a star right away.

77
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:24,698
Of course that makes me happy, but somehow I feel like
he's getting even bigger and slipping farther away.

78
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,248
Well, then...

79
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,798
Maybe I should go and challenge Gibson... As if...

80
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,008
Oh, by the way,

81
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:41,218
Shimizu, don't you think the first place Honda would
want to go as soon as he's back in Japan might be...

82
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,468
Honda

83
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:26,098
See you later dad, I'll come back.

84
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,488
Shimizu!

85
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:44,368
W-What a coincidence!

86
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:47,868
Liar! What are you doing here?

87
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:55,088
Uh... Well... Komori said you might be here and...

88
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:04,888
Sorry, I realized it was not really polite to interrupt
you while you were paying respect to your father...

89
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:11,098
Ugly? Well, you're not the most beautiful, but
you shouldn't say that about yourself!

90
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,848
I didn't say that!

91
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:16,518
Oh, uh... Then... It's all right.

92
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:21,028
Well since you're here, come and meet my dad!

93
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,528
Are you sure?

94
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:28,198
Yeah, my dad will like that.

95
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,118
Honda Family

96
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,168
So, are you all right?

97
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,588
I've been following your performance on
the internet and sports magazines.

98
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:48,048
It looks like you'll be promoted to the Majors next year, right?

99
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,718
Who knows.

100
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:55,558
The front office guys at the Hornets decided to
postpone my promotion when they heard about how,

101
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,568
I prioritized the Minors championship by pretending to be injured.

102
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:05,268
So instead, before going to the Majors, I was asked
to participate in the Arizona Fall Season League.

103
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,998
I think I got their attention now...

104
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:17,708
Somehow I feel like he's getting even
bigger and slipping farther away.

105
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:21,798
Oh, right!

106
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:26,178
On my way back, I wanted to come by your place to give you this!

107
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,978
I couldn't think of a really tasteful souvenir to bring you.

108
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:38,858
That's the ball from the game where
I go my first save with the Bats.

109
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:44,818
You said you'd like my autograph last summer's festival, right? So...

110
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,408
Thank you.

111
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:58,168
Wonder how fast I'll get a premium on it?

112
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:01,418
You want to sell it!?

113
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:05,055
Ah, what a feast that was!

114
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:07,885
Man, that was good!

115
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:12,515
Especially after eating hamburgers and sandwiches
almost every day over there.

116
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:15,435
Nothing compares to Japanese meals!

117
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:19,145
What you mean of course is "nothing compares
to your Mom's Japanese meals", right?

118
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:25,825
Yes that's it. Hey, Shingo, don't leave the tomatoes Mom made you!

119
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,035
She just cut them!

120
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:29,455
Oh, you're back Goro!

121
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:30,915
You look healthy!

122
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,375
Pa-Papa!

123
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:32,875
Papa!

124
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,795
You're hanging in there.

125
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:39,245
I never thought you would progress this much in just one year...

126
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:41,755
Well, I was lucky...

127
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,175
And next year, the Majors at last!

128
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:49,175
Yeah, I'm starting to see Gibson's back now.

129
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,305
Oh yeah, Father...

130
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:57,315
Who won the Championship this year?

131
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:00,975
Did Toshiya or Mayumura become regulars?

132
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:04,065
What? You mean you don't know?

133
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:12,365
This year, I didn't have much time to pay attention
to the Japanese baseball news...

134
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:14,995
I see.

135
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:18,585
You can take a look at the details yourself, on the computer.

136
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:21,295
Uh? On the computer?

137
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:25,135
What, don't tell me you can't use one?

138
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:27,215
What's wrong with that?

139
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:28,675
Shingo.

140
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:31,765
Why don't you show your brother how to use the computer?

141
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,135
No problem.

142
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,015
Thanks.

143
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,545
Come on, Goro nii-chan!

144
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,275
Me, too!

145
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:41,235
Okay, Chiharu you're coming too!

146
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,815
So he didn't have the time, huh?

147
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:51,785
No wonder he performed that well.

148
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:56,655
So you just have to input the word you want to look up here.

149
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:01,155
Wow, that's great! You're a genius, aren't you?

150
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,585
It's just common sense!

151
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,335
Chiharu, let's go downstairs to play.

152
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,255
What about Goro nii-chan?

153
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,675
Oh!

154
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:09,675
Later!

155
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,335
The first victory for the Tokyo Warriors in two years?

156
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,765
So the Oceans are in last place or something? That's lame!

157
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:22,305
Mayumura, with an ERA of 2.78 is in the top five of the whole league!

158
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,945
With 11 wins and 8 losses, he's the best of Yokohama!

159
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,305
Which means he got the Rookie of the Year title?

160
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,155
Well, that's not that surprising, I suppose.

161
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:34,315
What!?

162
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:38,285
"At the plate, he has a batting average of .312 with 18 home runs.

163
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:42,335
In defense, after he became the starter last June
because Yatabe withdrew due to an injury,

164
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:47,335
he's been performing extraordinarily, pulling the team with
incredible strength toward a tremendous turnaround."

165
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:54,055
Amazing Toshi! No, Mayumura, too!

166
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:57,805
Wow, I'm so happy!

167
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:09,155
Hey, Sato...

168
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:12,825
There's a journalist waiting for an interview in the lobby.

169
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,955
Oh, all right, excuse me.

170
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,285
Uh... Sorry for making you wait.

171
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:23,705
Oh, it's no problem really, it's my fault for imposing
this interview on you without an appointment.

172
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:28,995
And after you won the Rookie of the Year award, I thought it would
have gone to your head, and I would be turned away at the door.

173
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:31,925
Hmm, Toshi?

174
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:34,965
Have you already forgotten my voice?

175
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,595
Goro!

176
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:44,675
And that's how I thought I'd come to tell you I was back, and
at the same time see the face of the new Rookie of the Year.

177
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,985
I see. I'm grateful.

178
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,445
Oh, by the way, I got you a little souvenir from the States.

179
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,655
<i>No, those are clearly Japanese sweets...</i>

180
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:57,575
But, you are amazing, too. I was checking up
on your performance through the internet.

181
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,035
It's just starting now really.

182
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:02,875
I don't have any guarantee that I'll be promoted to the Majors,

183
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,295
and even if I do, I don't think it'll be easy to stay on the main roster.

184
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:08,795
<i>He's even eating them.</i>

185
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:12,135
W-Well, that's true for me, too.

186
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:15,795
Next year, Yatabe, the starting catcher,
will come back after he's recovered.

187
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,545
The real competition to be a starter will start then.

188
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:24,965
But to be honest, with the good results I got, I was hoping I might
get selected as a member of the Japanese national team.

189
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:28,565
The Japanese national team? What's that?

190
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,815
Eh, you don't know?

191
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:31,525
What is it?

192
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:35,865
Next spring, the Baseball World Cup
tournament composed of sixteen countries,

193
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:40,915
will be held in the USA to determine
who's really the best team in the world.

194
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,415
What? A tournament to determine the
best baseball team in the world?

195
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:49,295
That's right. The members of the delegation
were officially announced yesterday.

196
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:56,095
Coming from the Majors and the top Japanese players, they
all deserve the honor of being a representative, really.

197
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:59,345
The only rookie selected was Mayumura.

198
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:01,345
Mayumura?

199
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,605
I wanted to be selected, too... But, I wasn't.

200
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:09,815
The American national team was announced, too.

201
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:13,695
It started with Gibson and then a list of first-class Major Leaguers

202
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:16,115
Gibson!?

203
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:24,445
It's a dream tournament that gathers
all the top players in the world.

204
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:28,245
How exciting would it have been to
be selected for the Japanese team?

205
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:32,535
<i>The Japanese national team?</i>

206
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:37,045
<i>It doesn't really concern me for now.</i>

207
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,045
Softball Club

208
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,965
I'm off

209
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:38,885
Thank you for today!

210
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:39,465
Bye!

211
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:41,215
I'm so sorry, Shimi!

212
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:46,105
My boyfriend caught a cold and now we have
no way of going to that concert tonight.

213
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,775
Wasn't it Asami who invited you in the first place?

214
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:50,525
Yeah, and I'm greatful but...

215
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:55,055
I'm giving you my tickets so you can go with somebody else.

216
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:56,655
What?

217
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,405
With someone? But in such short notice--

218
00:15:58,405 --> 00:15:59,615
Sorry...

219
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:03,245
A concert?

220
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,955
Yes, you like this band, right?

221
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:10,245
That's no good. We have our final exams starting next week.

222
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,295
That's why I'm here studying instead of going to practice.

223
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,675
Just as I thought, it's not possible.

224
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:20,675
Maki and Misaki couldn't go either, even though
I would have been happy going with anyone.

225
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,765
Did you ask Shigeno senpai?

226
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,345
After all, he probably has a lot of free time, right?

227
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:33,485
Why would I ask him? There's just no way he would go
to a concert, you know he's only interested in baseball!

228
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,195
You're afraid he'll say no.

229
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:45,035
Not that I really care about your love life, but I'm sure you're
frustrated enough since you've become a university student.

230
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:48,325
But I can't see why you can't take it easy
and invite him to a simple concert.

231
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:54,715
I'm telling you he's just not interested! I don't want to bother
him with this invitation just because we're childhood friends--

232
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:57,795
So, you're content to always be just childhood friends?

233
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:05,175
If he's refusing to go to a simple concert with you, it's not because
he's not interested in the music, but that he's not interested in you.

234
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,795
If there's no spark, maybe you should try and
direct your efforts towards someone else.

235
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,445
Goro, can you answer?

236
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,025
All right!

237
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:23,235
Hello?

238
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:25,745
Oh, it's you, Shimizu?

239
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,865
Oh, a concert?

240
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:31,165
What, nobody else wants to go?

241
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,875
As I thought, it's not your thing.

242
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:35,965
If you can't go, just tell me--

243
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:36,465
Sounds good.

244
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,385
They open the door for ticket holders at six, right?

245
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:47,175
Was that Shimizu?

246
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:52,145
Yeah, apparently she suddenly found herself with no
one to go to a concert, so she's asked me if I could.

247
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,315
Since I'm free anyway, I said I would go.

248
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:06,445
Ah, what am I going to do?! What am I going to wear?!

249
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,655
Uh, this isn't good. Uh...

250
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:11,375
Hey!

251
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:13,705
I'm home!

252
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:15,705
Welcome back!

253
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,285
Hey Goro, are you going somewhere?

254
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,425
Yeah.

255
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,685
He has a date with Shimizu!

256
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,475
It's not what you think!

257
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:34,465
You're here early today.

258
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:38,705
Yeah, we've finished this years adjustment for the World Cup, so...

259
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,205
Adjustments for the World Cup?

260
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,125
Father, are you working for the World Cup?

261
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:45,765
Yeah.

262
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,005
I'm the pitching and head coach for the national team.

263
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:50,675
I didn't tell you?

264
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,935
No, you didn't!

265
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:58,605
Then why couldn't you get me or Toshi selected, father?

266
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:00,995
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

267
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:04,275
The right to decide who's selected belongs to Coach Sasaki anyway.

268
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,065
Besides you're just a Minor Leaguer,

269
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:10,195
and as for Sato, the burden of being the catcher
for that team is still a bit too heavy.

270
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:12,655
Of course, it's not impossible.

271
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,035
There's no rush, you know.

272
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:19,245
You're still very young, you'll have your chance.

273
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:22,505
There will be another World Cup in four years.

274
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,715
In four years, huh?

275
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:31,305
So this is the last time one could fight against
the American team with Gibson on it.

276
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:38,865
Goro!

277
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:43,605
Although the odds aren't very high, there's
still a way to be selected for the team.

278
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:48,605
There will be a practice game during training
camp for the national team next January.

279
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,235
They plan to pick up some of the young pro players who
will play against the delegation during that match.

280
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:56,155
If you manage to catch Coach Sasaki's
eye with your skills during the game,

281
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:58,865
then there's a slight chance you might be selected.

282
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:06,165
And this is because he's a coach who doesn't care about
careers or names, he only wants to bring the best of Japan.

283
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,965
Mifune Station

284
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,965
South Exit

285
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,805
What, there's still a chance to get onto the national team?

286
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:23,855
Yeah, during that practice match we just have to
perform well enough to appeal to the coach.

287
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:30,105
And even if we don't get selected, just the chance to face
the best team in history is just too exciting, isn't it?

288
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:34,035
What's wrong?

289
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:37,405
Nothing, I was just thinking that you really haven't changed a bit.

290
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:42,995
I'm in, that sort of chance is too good to pass on. I'll apply, too.

291
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:46,375
Amd who knows we might be able to form a battery again.

292
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,585
Father!

293
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,965
Toshi said he'd apply to play on the practice game team as well!

294
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:53,045
Oh, good.

295
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:56,095
With that, I'm sure we'll be the first battery.

296
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:57,675
Hey, Goro!

297
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:59,685
Why are you still here?

298
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:01,685
What do you mean "huh"?

299
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:05,105
Weren't you supposed to meet Shimizu at six?

300
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,855
Shimizu? Meeting?

301
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,735
I completely forgot!

302
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,615
Goro, call her first!

303
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,445
It's probably her.

304
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:23,325
Hello?

305
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:26,165
Oh, Shimizu, I'm so sorry.

306
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:29,755
Something came up and I lost track
of time. I was just about to leave.

307
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:34,845
Oh, I see, you didn't call and I thought maybe
you had an accident or something...

308
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,425
So you just haven't left yet!

309
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:43,235
I'm sorry! But now that I think of it, if you wait for me
to arrive you'll just miss everything, won't you?

310
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:47,395
Don't worry about me and just go by
yourself. I'm not worth the trouble.

311
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:56,905
I understand.

312
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:01,535
It's my fault, I shouldn't have invited
you on such short notice. I'm sorry.

313
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,625
What, you're not going?

314
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,795
Well yeah, if I leave now I won't make it.

315
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:15,005
She shouldn't miss the concert just because
she has to wait for me, right?

316
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,030
Taiga, dinner!

317
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,160
All right.

318
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,790
Huh?

319
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,920
What happened sis? It's not even eight
o'clock, what happened with the concert?

320
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,560
You were wrong... It was a mistake to ask a guy like him.

321
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,770
What's wrong? Didn't you go to the concert together?

322
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,270
Did you guys have a fight--

323
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,060
It's gone.

324
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,800
Somehow all the excitement's gone.

325
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,570
It's fine, nothing wrong with staying childhood friends forever.

326
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,113
Cheers.

327
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:17,573
Oh, Nogoro! It's been a while, how are you?

328
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:18,993
Well, I'm good.

329
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:22,873
I'm here about that phone call the other day.

330
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:26,043
I was thinking about using the field to keep in shape.

331
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:27,923
Oh yes, of course. That's not a problem.

332
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,003
Besides, there aren't any practices now due to exams.

333
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:32,423
Thanks!

334
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:33,713
Ah Nogoro...

335
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:37,433
While you're at it, could you go and talk to Shimizu?

336
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,643
I'm sure he'd like to talk to his successful upperclassmen.

337
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,903
I'm not sure he'd really like that.

338
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,113
Heh, this brings back good memories;

339
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:52,823
this field left us badly drained, but we were able to overcome it.

340
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:56,543
And now you got some more new members.
I hear you're working hard, Captain.

341
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:59,453
What sorts of results did you get over the summer?

342
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:02,243
Nothing to speak of really. Clearly we're far from it.

343
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:06,173
Actually, the only time Seishuu had results
was when you were on the team.

344
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:09,713
Now, just getting beyond the second round is reason to be greatful.

345
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,213
Senpai.

346
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:16,553
Yeah?

347
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:18,883
Did you do something to my sister yesterday?

348
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:21,443
Huh?

349
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:25,023
She came back home without going to the concert.

350
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:25,563
Eh?

351
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:28,193
And she was really angry for some reason.

352
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:30,483
So I thought maybe you did something a little too abrupt or--

353
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:32,363
Are you insane?!

354
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:35,323
Then why was she so angry when she came back?

355
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,663
Huh, what are you talking about?

356
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:43,373
Something came up right before the start of the concert and
since I couldn't make it on time, I told her to go without me!

357
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,253
Man, you're the worst.

358
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:48,963
What?

359
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:52,383
So you were going to be late, but why didn't you still go?

360
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:55,173
You can always get in even when the concert has already begun,

361
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,553
but that was beside the point, wasn't it?

362
00:24:58,383 --> 00:25:00,933
Point? What point are you talking about?

363
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:04,353
She bought tickets because she wanted to see the concert, right?

364
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:07,603
I was feeling bad about her missing half of it just
because of me, so I did what I did because,

365
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:09,313
I thought that was the considerate thing to do!

366
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:12,403
You really don't get it, do you?

367
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:17,783
Excuse me, my class is about to start.

368
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,363
Hey Taiga!

369
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:21,793
What don't I understand?

370
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:26,043
If you're that thick-headed, she'll be disgusted with you.

371
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:31,043
I suppose it's fine if you have no intention
of ever having anything more than just...

372
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,423
A childhood friendship relationship with my sister.

373
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:38,842
Really?

374
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:41,892
Yes, Coach Sasaki of the Japanese National Team insisted,

375
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:47,932
that you were to be one of the players
selected for the Young Japan team.

376
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:51,902
Thank you very much! Do you know about the others?

377
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:57,282
Do you know if Shigeno Goro has been selected as a member?

378
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:58,322
Shigeno?

379
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:03,372
Y-Yes, right now he's the pitcher for the Memphis Bats in Triple A.

380
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:07,202
Ah I see, I don't think he'll be able to make it.

381
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,758
If you're that thick-headed, she'll be disgusted with you.

382
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:22,218
I suppose it's fine if you have no intention
of ever having anything more than just...

383
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:24,178
A childhood friendship relationship with my sister.

384
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,488
It's too early to go home.

385
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:44,988
Keep it coming; next one!

386
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:50,578
Oops, sorry!

387
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,258
More!

388
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:02,388
It's getting dark, it's time we pack it up.

389
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:04,308
Y-Yeah.

390
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,058
I wonder what happened.

391
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:11,978
The way she's losing herself completely in her training
seems like she's trying to get something off her mind.

392
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:12,648
Yeah.

393
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,988
<i>Sports sure are comforting.</i>

394
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:20,568
<i>I feel a lot better.</i>

395
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:22,908
<i>I'm over it anyway.</i>

396
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:26,658
<i>Throwing myself into softball suits me well.</i>

397
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,618
A peeping tom!

398
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:32,878
I'm telling you I'm not a peeping tom, so stop shouting!

399
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,728
Then explain to me what a man is doing here?

400
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:39,548
Don't you know boys aren't allowed on campus?

401
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:41,198
I didn't know!

402
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:43,778
If you don't leave immediately, I'll call the guards.

403
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,348
Will you just shut up! Do you have a
freshman by the name of Shimizu here?

404
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:49,398
I just came to see her!

405
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:51,388
Hu, Shimi?

406
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:54,978
Hey, Shimizu!

407
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,898
They're treating me like I'm some peeping tom...

408
00:27:58,148 --> 00:27:59,938
Please help me out!

409
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:04,288
Say, is he the so-called boyfriend everyone is talking about?

410
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:07,788
But that's no good, you know boys aren't allowed inside the school.

411
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:12,708
Huh, who is this person?

412
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:19,548
How could a softball girl as zealous as me have a boyfriend anyway?

413
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:22,928
Call the guards, quick!

414
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:23,428
Yes!

415
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,308
Hey! Wait a second, I'm innocent!

416
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:29,008
Damn it!

417
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:33,058
Hey Shimizu, what are you so angry about?!
If it's about yesterday, I'm here to apol--

418
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:39,148
Sorry, I did end up peeping...

419
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:44,658
I'm not really angry.

420
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:48,578
I know you didn't mean any harm...

421
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:52,338
I'd say you were probably late because
of some baseball-related business.

422
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:58,498
That's why I'm not particularly angry that you were late
or that we didn't get to go to the concert together.

423
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:00,918
It's just <i>that</i>...

424
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:06,548
Because you meant no harm, it just explained how
different our feelings towards each other really are.

425
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:10,218
And the reason why you couldn't tell me
you'd come even if you were late,

426
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:14,348
was because you weren't even a little excited about all this.

427
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:21,358
But I'm fine now.

428
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:26,528
I don't mind being as we were before; just good
friends who share a joke once in a while.

429
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:30,328
Even if I can't have it all, I don't want to lose everything.

430
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:37,538
<i>I didn't see that coming.</i>

431
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:44,008
<i>Ever since we were kids, Shimizu's always been a baseball
teammate, a friend, even almost family...</i>

432
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:47,178
<i>But I've never even once thought of her as a woman.</i>

433
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:48,588
<i>And yet...</i>

434
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:55,308
<i>She</i> is <i>a woman.</i>

435
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:57,893
I'm really sorry, Goro!

436
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:02,353
I know I got your hopes up saying you
would get in if you just applied,

437
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:06,483
as it turns out, you won't be able to participate in the game
between the young players and the national team.

438
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:11,533
I-I did recommend you, but the circumstances have changed and...

439
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:14,913
Well, the truth is that the only players on that team will--

440
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:15,953
I see.

441
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:19,873
Well then, there's nothing to be done about it... I understand.

442
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:22,253
G-Goro?

443
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,423
He's acting strangely.

444
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,053
How so?

445
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:36,063
Well see, last night when I told Goro he wouldn't be selected
to the young players' team, he just kept his cool...

446
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:40,643
He couldn't wait to face the Japanese team before that.

447
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:42,523
At first I thought he'd be furious,

448
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:45,903
but instead he just said there's nothing he can do about it.

449
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:50,533
Now that you mention it, today he suddenly
left without eating breakfast this morning.

450
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:55,113
Hmm, I suppose from time to time he can be relaxed.

451
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:57,283
Well, I'm off.

452
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:58,703
Have a safe trip.

453
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:08,553
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

454
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,893
<i>I couldn't sleep at all last night.</i>

455
00:31:12,013 --> 00:31:15,553
It was because you weren't even a little excited about all this.

456
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:18,303
<i>That's not it.</i>

457
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:23,433
<i>It's just that she's always been like a
friend to me and I never imagined...</i>

458
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:28,363
<i>Something so embarrassing as a formal
date or just going out with her.</i>

459
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,483
No-go-ro!

460
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:32,533
What the hell--

461
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:36,033
What are you daydreaming about?

462
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:37,913
Hey, are you doing well?

463
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:40,333
Tashiro... Fuji...

464
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:47,423
Taiga told us you had returned, and that you would
take it easy and work out here for a while.

465
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:51,713
Uchiyama and Miyazaki said they couldn't skip their classes.

466
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:54,013
They're not very fun, are they?!

467
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,723
But they really wanted to see you, and pass on a "hello".

468
00:31:57,723 --> 00:31:59,593
Ah, really?

469
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:01,183
So, how was it?

470
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,563
What's your impression of baseball as
it's played in the game's homeland?

471
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:08,603
Well, wherever you are, baseball is baseball you know.

472
00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:11,323
But I suppose I have a good feel for it.

473
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:14,193
That's exactly what I thought you'd say.

474
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:19,913
After all, you're the guy who thought of defeating Kaido
when there wasn't even a baseball club in Seishuu.

475
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:21,243
But still...

476
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,753
Who thought that they would still be using this field.

477
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:28,553
We didn't go to Koshien, but this place
brings back the best memories.

478
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,133
but, we missed our entrance into the university, though.

479
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,513
Don't blame that on baseball!

480
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:40,603
We've been checking up on your preformance
in magazines and on the Internet.

481
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,733
You know that everyone's still cheering on Seishuu's old boy.

482
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:45,773
Speaking of which...

483
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:48,143
Have you seen Kaoru?

484
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:52,363
What? Where did that come from?

485
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:55,493
I bumped into her on the train the other day.

486
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:02,073
Are you sure?

487
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:03,833
Yes, I'm fine.

488
00:33:05,623 --> 00:33:06,833
Thank you.

489
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:17,383
Kaoru!

490
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:22,843
Oh, it's you Fuji! You scared me.

491
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,973
Coming home from practice?

492
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:25,723
Yeah.

493
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:28,023
You're still into softball, I see.

494
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:29,813
And what's wrong with that?

495
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:37,443
Well no, it's just that girls your age, instead of a sweaty
and smelly sports try and get dressed up,

496
00:33:37,443 --> 00:33:39,693
to go out on dates with good men.

497
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,703
By the way, would you like to go out with me?

498
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:44,663
I don't need that.

499
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:48,883
You don't need it? Do you mean there's a new guy...

500
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,793
Seriously?

501
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:56,003
It's because in my case, when I sweat chasing the ball,

502
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:59,633
I can always feel like I'm on a date.

503
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:04,183
Even someone as slow as you can
understand what that means, right?

504
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:08,933
Kaoru is still desperately chasing balls to feel even a little closer,

505
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:11,273
to that baseball nutcase who left so far away.

506
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,153
I'll add just this Shigeno.

507
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:21,113
Baseball is great and all, but when a girl has these kind of feelings...

508
00:34:21,413 --> 00:34:23,163
A respectable man should answer them properly.

509
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:33,916
Kaoru is still desperately chasing balls to feel even a little closer,

510
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:37,176
to that baseball nutcase who left so far away.

511
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:41,716
Even if I can't have it all, I don't want to lose everything.

512
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,846
Ah, being gloomy won't do me any good!

513
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,516
A man just has to act sometimes.

514
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:51,356
Good work everyone!

515
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:03,076
Y-Yes... Hello?

516
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:05,996
Huh?

517
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:08,166
T-Tomorrow?

518
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,666
Well there's no practice, so yeah, sure.

519
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,256
All right then, at 10 in front of the entrance?

520
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:31,186
We're here!

521
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:34,516
This place is great. They have both an
amusement park and an aquarium!

522
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,276
We're going to have a lot of fun today!

523
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:38,106
You're too eager.

524
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,996
All right, where do you want to start?

525
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,066
I'm fine with anything...

526
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:45,876
Well then... Let's start with that?

527
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:48,036
Ah, that's no good.

528
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,576
I'll wet myself on a roller coaster.

529
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:50,076
What?

530
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:51,626
Then how about that one?

531
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,996
I'll get a nose bleed on the spinning one.

532
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,506
So that one is no good either?

533
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:58,046
Yeah, we'll both wet ourselves.

534
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:00,176
Then let's go to that one!

535
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:02,636
Hmm, heights, I'll wet myself on that, too.

536
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:04,346
Let's go home.

537
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:11,766
Come on, I was just joking!

538
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:17,066
Do you know how many times I got through tight
spots with two outs and the bases loaded?

539
00:36:17,396 --> 00:36:19,236
This is nothing in comparison.

540
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:20,356
Hey, wait a minute!

541
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:42,756
You weren't joking.

542
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:44,086
Are you all right?

543
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:47,806
Yes, I'm fine. That was nothing.

544
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,226
You know me... In pinches with two outs, bases loaded...

545
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,976
Well, how about stopping for lunch?

546
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:58,186
I brought a Bento box.

547
00:36:58,186 --> 00:36:59,526
Oh?

548
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,316
Did you make all of that?

549
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:03,106
Yeah...

550
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:05,866
But are you sure you'll be able to eat in your condition?

551
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:08,156
I'm fine, I'm fine!

552
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,286
Thanks for the food!

553
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:19,246
Is it good?

554
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:20,586
Yeah, great!

555
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:23,756
What a relief, I'm glad.

556
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:58,246
Amazing!

557
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:01,876
Look at that Shimizu! That's a ray, a ray!

558
00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:04,296
Don't you think it looks a little like Komori?

559
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:07,886
What's so funny?

560
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:16,056
No, it's just I was thinking there are a bunch of things I don't know.

561
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,686
You mean like the fact that Komori looks like a ray?

562
00:38:18,726 --> 00:38:19,806
No!

563
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:27,696
I was thinking that the only Honda Goro
I know, is the one on his mound.

564
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,736
This is the Honda that's afraid of roller coasters...

565
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:34,916
And gets so gleeful visiting the aquarium.

566
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:38,496
This is the first time I've seen that Honda.

567
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,206
That's what I was thinking.

568
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:01,856
Ah, that was fun!

569
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:08,946
I feel so good! It's been such a long
time since I've been to the sea...

570
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,446
Last time was in junior high, maybe.

571
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:14,406
Forgive me.

572
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:15,196
Huh?

573
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:20,666
You were concerned about the strange things I said
last time, and you felt you had to make up for it.

574
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:25,836
Otherwise, there's just no way you'd ask me out like you did.

575
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:28,256
But I'm fine now.

576
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:32,426
Because I like the Honda with nothing but baseball in his head.

577
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:39,726
However, if one day you start yearning for something
else other than baseball, let me know.

578
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:45,776
If I'll be free, I'll consider helping you.

579
00:39:53,236 --> 00:39:54,776
Shall we head home?

580
00:39:57,746 --> 00:39:59,206
You dummy.

581
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:01,286
Do you honestly think,

582
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:05,796
I'm not sensitive enough to spend a whole day just to
atone for something, for a mere childhood friend?

583
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,046
Maybe...

584
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:14,046
I just wanted to go out on a normal date with the girl I like.

585
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:22,686
And my heart's been throbbing today more than any situations
I've had with two outs and bases loaded.

586
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:26,816
I'm a guy who's so thick, he needs 10 years to notice something...

587
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:29,186
Are you fine with that?

588
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,486
Yeah.

589
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:35,196
I'll think about it.

590
00:40:57,265 --> 00:41:01,685
I just wanted to go out on a regular date with the girl I like.

591
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,935
<i>That wasn't a dream, was it?</i>

592
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:10,775
<i>Honda really professed his love to me, didn't he?</i>

593
00:41:13,235 --> 00:41:15,025
<i>So we...</i>

594
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:21,025
Hey...

595
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:24,065
Your panties are showing.

596
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:27,385
W-What the hell! Don't you knock?!

597
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:32,185
I did, I did. But you were screaming "AH" or something so...

598
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:35,435
Here's the CD I borrowed.

599
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:36,395
Oh.

600
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:38,985
So, did something good happen or what?

601
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:45,735
Well... You were of some help in this so I'll tell you.

602
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:47,485
As a matter of fact...

603
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,905
What, seriously?!

604
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,570
Huh?

605
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,750
Oh, Goro. So you're training normally again?

606
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,870
I thought you may have had some problems with your health.

607
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,460
What are you talking about?

608
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,750
I've always been in good shape!

609
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,130
Never mind that father, what about that practice
game against the Japanese team?

610
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,050
Practice game?

611
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,970
Stop playing dumb!

612
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,180
I'm talking about you getting me on the young players' team.

613
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,940
Huh, what are you talking about?

614
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,690
Don't you remember I told you in your
room that it wasn't possible anymore.

615
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,980
Oh, really?

616
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,900
I was thinking about something completely different at the time...

617
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,200
Are you sure you're all right?

618
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,780
But, wait... Why isn't it possible anymore?

619
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,160
You're the coach, aren't you?!

620
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
How difficult can it be to just let me go to a practice game?!

621
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,170
That's enough. Stop it, will you!

622
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,210
The circumstances have changed.

623
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,510
Before training camp, all the clubs were
reluctant to let go of their players.

624
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:05,010
In order to avoid creating a mess, it was decided
that it will be a gathering of players,

625
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,640
coming from all 12 teams, with each sending two players.

626
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,770
In other words, only professional Japanese players can participate?

627
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,350
What about Toshiya?

628
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:20,400
Yeah, Sato was chosen without any problems
since he applied in the first place.

629
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,620
I understand you're not happy, but you should let it go.

630
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,080
It will always be like that; nothing will
happen even if it goes through me.

631
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,210
But I guess if you want to participate that much,

632
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,380
you could always replace me at the
camp as a batting practice pitcher!

633
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,090
Of course, that would be volunteering!

634
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,130
Quit joking around!

635
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,640
Why should I be a batting practice pitcher when
I'm one step away from the Majors?!

636
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,680
No... Hold on.

637
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,060
A batting practice pitcher...

638
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,730
Yes, that's it.

639
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,900
Even without playing in that game, that should be enough!

640
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,200
All right, let's do it!

641
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:09,926
Today's Sport Flash.

642
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:16,426
Let's start with baseball; this morning Saeki
Kyoshiro came back from the United States.

643
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:23,226
It's an impressive return for Kyoshiro; his batting average this
season was .397 and he set the single-season record for hits;

644
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:25,146
a record which he previously held.

645
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:32,276
He arrived early in order to prepare for next
January's World Cup, in the Japanese team camp.

646
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,660
Hello, Sato speaking.

647
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,870
Oh Toshi, do you have any plans for tomorrow?

648
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:44,620
If not, what do you think about training together?

649
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,630
Yeah sure, I don't have any other plans anyway.

650
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,670
Oh, sorry by the way, about what
happened with the Japanese national team.

651
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,180
That's going to work out fine actually.

652
00:44:56,223 --> 00:44:58,143
Christmas Eve's coming up, huh?

653
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:02,353
Speaking of which, how are things going with Shigeno?

654
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:04,813
What things...?

655
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:07,773
Quit joking around, you know what I mean.

656
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:11,773
I'm asking about the developments since he professed his love.

657
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:16,823
Well I guess there aren't any developments
to speak of, we haven't gone out since then.

658
00:45:16,823 --> 00:45:19,953
I can't believe it, but it's been almost two weeks!

659
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:26,753
Oh, but we spoke on the phone two or
three times. He finally got a cell phone.

660
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:30,753
Just two or three times? Is Shigeno <i>that</i> busy?

661
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:33,713
Busy? Not at all, he's free I think.

662
00:45:34,053 --> 00:45:36,723
I guess it's just that we're both not really used to this yet--

663
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:37,343
Kaoru!

664
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:39,343
Are you sure this is going to work?

665
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:40,553
Is what?

666
00:45:40,553 --> 00:45:42,553
Well, in the beginning it's about constantly being
with each other or talking on the phone.

667
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:52,443
Well he's not really a chatterbox you know, he's basically
the hardcore athletic type, so it's no surprise that he--

668
00:45:52,903 --> 00:45:55,233
That's no good, Kaoru!

669
00:45:55,783 --> 00:46:01,203
There are tons of couples who start dating because of mutual
attraction and end up splitting because they let little things slip.

670
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:06,043
Don't be thinking you can relax just because it's
taken 10 years for your love to come to fruition!

671
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:08,373
Because your passion starts now, understand?

672
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,929
It's busy?

673
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:24,514
First Itao, now Kyoshiro is back, too!

674
00:46:25,894 --> 00:46:29,234
I can't wait to face them!

675
00:46:31,144 --> 00:46:32,944
Can't wait to face what?

676
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:36,694
What the hell?!

677
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:40,324
You're saying you want to participate in training
camp even as a batting practice pitcher?

678
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:43,994
Yes, isn't that what you advised me to do?

679
00:46:43,994 --> 00:46:47,704
I-Idiot, I was obviously joking about that.

680
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,254
Well sorry, but I'm serious about it now.

681
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:53,754
Of course, I don't mind paying for it myself,
and I'm sure the training staff won't object.

682
00:46:54,464 --> 00:46:55,924
Wait a minute!

683
00:46:55,924 --> 00:46:59,344
Who's ever heard of a batting practice pitcher
on the active roster that throws 150 km/h?

684
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:07,224
Don't tell me you're thinking of doing
something that'll make waves again?

685
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:12,984
Being a batting practice pitcher doesn't matter, if I can
have Kyoshiro or Itao in front of me, it'll be all right.

686
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:15,904
If I can hold down top-class Major Leaguers like them,

687
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:19,324
the coach of the Japanese team won't be able to ignore me.

688
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:25,784
I know it's a little extreme, but that's the only
way I have to show my worth to them, father!

689
00:47:25,786 --> 00:47:29,326
All right then, let's meet at one o'clock in
front of the Sports Center tomorrow...

690
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:32,416
Huh? My battery is dead.

691
00:47:33,046 --> 00:47:36,336
Well it doesn't matter, I told him everything I needed to say.

692
00:47:39,086 --> 00:47:46,556
We cannot connect to the number you dialed
because it is out of range or turned off.

693
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:50,476
Is this a little slip up?

694
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:57,066
<i>And Christmas Eve is the day after tomorrow...</i>

695
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:07,406
There are tons of couples who start dating because of mutual
attraction and end up splitting because they let little things slip.

696
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:08,956
All right!

697
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,336
What's wrong all of a sudden, Shimizu?

698
00:48:17,336 --> 00:48:22,046
It's not that sudden, you know. I tried to call
you yesterday but it wouldn't connect.

699
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:26,016
Sorry about that, the battery ran out and I left it like that.

700
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,426
Geez!

701
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:28,556
What brings you here?

702
00:48:29,846 --> 00:48:32,556
Uh, are you free today?

703
00:48:33,436 --> 00:48:39,906
Since my break starts today, I thought that maybe if
you were free we could do some shopping together--

704
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:41,066
Ah, sorry.

705
00:48:41,946 --> 00:48:45,656
I've arranged a training session with Toshi this afternoon.

706
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:51,876
Fine, then. I'll just go by myself.

707
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:55,666
Do you want to come with us?

708
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:01,506
We're just going to do a light workout
in the warm water pool at the gym.

709
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:03,846
You would like that, wouldn't you?

710
00:49:10,936 --> 00:49:13,516
I knew I should have said no...

711
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:19,776
It's been a long while since he last saw me
in a bathing suit, and then there's Toshiya.

712
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:21,486
Hey, you're late Shimizu!

713
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,156
Hello.

714
00:49:27,736 --> 00:49:32,576
We already met each other during out Little
League game, but we were never formally introduced.

715
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:35,086
My name is Sato Toshiya, nice to meet you.

716
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:38,416
And I'm Shimizu, I always watch you play on TV.

717
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:42,256
I'm sorry to barge in your plans like this.

718
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:46,096
Not at all. Besides aren't I the third wheel here?

719
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:50,556
Don't worry about that, I wouldn't mind if it was just the two of us!

720
00:49:52,186 --> 00:49:56,396
W-Well since we're going to walk laps in
the pool, and a boring workout session,

721
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:59,226
you should go over there and do whatever you want.

722
00:49:59,316 --> 00:50:00,106
Excuse me.

723
00:50:01,356 --> 00:50:05,526
What? Even though joke unexpectedly worked well.

724
00:50:06,576 --> 00:50:09,786
You're going to be a batting practice pitcher for the training camp?

725
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:10,536
Yeah.

726
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:15,416
If I can hold down the likes of Kyoshiro and Itao,
it'll be enough to prove my worth to the Coach.

727
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:20,546
But, they're super stars in the Majors... That's so reckless!

728
00:50:23,836 --> 00:50:26,466
Well, I won't know until I try.

729
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:29,966
And it's my only way to get onto the team anyway.

730
00:50:31,176 --> 00:50:32,886
But before that Toshi,

731
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:36,436
I think our bodies have loosened up now,
what do you say to a little race?

732
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:46,656
Ah, damn it!

733
00:50:46,656 --> 00:50:48,196
One more!

734
00:50:48,986 --> 00:50:50,486
Fine, as many as you want!

735
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:52,156
All right, let's go! And go!

736
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:52,956
Backstroke!?

737
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:54,956


738
00:50:59,286 --> 00:51:00,336
Yeah!

739
00:51:00,746 --> 00:51:03,626
Men's Locker Room

740
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:03,626
That was a good workout!

741
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:08,136
Really, when you train with someone
else, it's much more encouraging.

742
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:09,676
Goro.

743
00:51:09,676 --> 00:51:10,426
Huh?

744
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:16,596
I brought these. What do you say, we
play catch just a little to finish?

745
00:51:31,236 --> 00:51:33,076
It's been a while, huh?

746
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:37,416
Yeah, ever since Kaido I suppose.

747
00:51:43,836 --> 00:51:46,166
Well, I guess you can sit now.

748
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:51,756
You're on your time off, and it's not good for your shoulder.

749
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:53,266
Don't worry!

750
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:57,846
My shoulder's warmed up enough, and
my body isn't that delicate you know.

751
00:52:01,396 --> 00:52:02,976
Only one pitch, then.

752
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:10,406
<i>Wow, it's been a long time since I last
saw Honda's pitch from up close.</i>

753
00:52:13,156 --> 00:52:16,656
<i>I admit Kyoshiro or Itao won't be easy.</i>

754
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:27,046
<i>But Toshi, you have to understand that I didn't
go to America on a sightseeing tour!</i>

755
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:43,686
<i>I see.</i>

756
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:48,776
<i>The camp could see a storm coming through next month.</i>

757
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:57,536
That was awesome! Did you get even faster, Honda?

758
00:52:57,536 --> 00:53:01,536
It's not fast enough, my goal is to reach 170 km/h.

759
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:08,126
Next year, I will break in as a batting practice
pitcher and will make them recognize my skill.

760
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:11,836
<i>That's right, it means we won't get to see each other for a while.</i>

761
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,556
<i>Well, maybe taking it easy is good, too.</i>

762
00:53:18,556 --> 00:53:22,306
<i>After all, it's not really his style to be romantic.</i>

763
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:24,396
Hey Shimizu...

764
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:25,356
Hmm?

765
00:53:25,356 --> 00:53:27,476
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, right?

766
00:53:27,476 --> 00:53:29,436
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

767
00:53:34,906 --> 00:53:35,866
Yes!

768
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:42,416
You suck! You call that a swinging?

769
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,666
Use your hips! Swing with your hips!

770
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:47,336
No!

771
00:53:47,796 --> 00:53:53,676
<i>This isn't right, this is not a place for Christmas Eve, Honda!</i>

772
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:55,631
Welcome

773
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:57,631
It's still chilly here in Okinawa.

774
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,891
For the upcoming baseball World Cup next March,

775
00:54:00,891 --> 00:54:05,851
the players from the Japanese national team are
gathering here for training camp, which will start tomorrow.

776
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:11,311
Above all, the attention is of course centered
on the Major Leaguers Kyoshiro and Itao.

777
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:16,281
Both gave up their winter breaks to come
here and train for the World Cup.

778
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:21,071
Living up to their reputation of world class players,
they're true inspiration for all the Japanese team.

779
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,411
Uh... Genttlemen, thank you all for coming.

780
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:30,131
I firmly believe that all the members gathered
here have all it takes to take on the world.

781
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:33,961
During this camp, plase be very
careful with your individual training,

782
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:36,551
and try not to overexert yourselves.

783
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:38,631
I wish you all good luck!

784
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:50,231
Hello there.

785
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:57,611
Here's the thing, I'm a batting practice
pitcher here but I don't know anyone.

786
00:54:57,611 --> 00:55:00,361
And I feel lonely, would you mind talking to me?

787
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:05,081
Man you're cold, Mayumura.

788
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:06,911
It's me!

789
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:09,411
S-Shigeno?! What are you doing here?

790
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:12,711
Like I said I'm a batting practice pitcher.

791
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:16,421
My father, the pitching coach, pulled some
strings and the head coach agreed.

792
00:55:16,421 --> 00:55:19,421
But I could get in trouble if I show my face, hence the disguise.

793
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:21,511
Are you Mayumura?

794
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:28,061
Pleasure to meet you, we've heard rumors about
the strong-armed rookie way over in the States.

795
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:29,681
<i>Kyoshiro!</i>

796
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:32,481
Let's both do our best as representatives of Japan.

797
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:34,361
Yes, I hope we will.

798
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:44,621
Excuse me, you there.

799
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:50,791
I apologize if I'm mistaken, but aren't
you Shigeno from the Triple A Bats?

800
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:58,801
Am I that famous? It's really an honor that you know of me.

801
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:02,761
I was right; yes, I've heard of you.

802
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:08,141
When a Japanese performs well, even if it's just in the Minors,
you can't help but hear about them, whether you like it or not.

803
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,271
But still, why are you here?

804
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:15,771
Only players from the national team
have been called here, I believe.

805
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:20,941
I'm glad you said that, I was wondering what
arrangements I would have to make to get a meeting,

806
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:23,281
now I can save a great deal of effort.

807
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:24,161
<i>A meeting?</i>

808
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:27,451
Ah, thanks. Let's do the rest together.

809
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:33,161
When you have batting practice, please ask
for me to be your batting practice pitcher.

810
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:40,421
I'll show you pitches that are much more lively than all
the coaches and batting practice pitchers over there.

811
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:43,131
T-T-Time!

812
00:56:45,141 --> 00:56:47,551
What are you doing? You're way out of line!

813
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,391
Did you forget I only brought you here
because you promised to behave?

814
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:52,431
I forgot.

815
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:55,521
Sorry.

816
00:56:56,691 --> 00:57:00,191
But I'm afraid you won't be able to pitch against me.

817
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:01,441
What?

818
00:57:01,441 --> 00:57:08,201
Because, I have my own exclusive batting
practice pitcher, and I only train with him.

819
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:10,621
You''ll have to try your luck with someone else.

820
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:24,051
I'm afraid you won't be able to pitch against me.

821
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:30,761
<i>That's strange, usually in that situation I'd have tried
to insist and say something like "come on, please".</i>

822
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:38,311
<i>The atmosphere, how should I say... He had an aura backed
by total self-confidence, which left me no opening.</i>

823
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:43,691
<i>Well I guess if there's nothing to be done about Kyoshiro,</i>

824
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:47,951
<i>I'll have to try to sneak in when Itao starts his batting practice.</i>

825
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:48,701
Hey.

826
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:52,081
Are you a batting practice pitcher?

827
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:54,001
I am, what about it?

828
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,001
Don't just sit there!

829
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:59,631
There's equipment to put away, pitching
to do. There are plenty of jobs to be done!

830
00:58:00,171 --> 00:58:03,421
Being a batting practice pitcher also includes
doing all sortsof chores. You idiot!

831
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:07,221
What? Who do you think you are?

832
00:58:07,681 --> 00:58:10,221
I'm Nemoto, batting practice pitcher.

833
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:13,181
Coach Shigeno has asked me to train and keep an eye on you.

834
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:17,941
Hey, can't you carry that a little faster?!

835
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:18,981
Yeah, yeah.

836
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:21,361
What sort of an answer is that? Use some effort will you!

837
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:22,271
Yes!

838
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:26,321
Stop dawdling and put these away right now!

839
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:27,571
All right, old man.

840
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:28,531
Who are you calling old?!

841
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,371
Hey, still here? It's going to be dark soon!

842
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:34,201
Man, he's a pain!

843
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:36,371
Huh, did you say something?

844
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:39,371
Nothing, your ears must be playing tricks on you!

845
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:44,501
You said you asked Kyoshiro for a match yesterday, right?

846
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:47,551
Don't push your luck because your father is here as coach.

847
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:50,971
I don't know what you're worth in Triple A,

848
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:53,391
but surely it's way too early to have such a big mouth...

849
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:54,391
You punk!

850
00:58:55,771 --> 00:58:57,981
Okay, that's enough old man!

851
00:58:58,231 --> 00:59:02,521
Who do you think you are?! You keep nagging at me...

852
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:04,861
Do you get your kicks bullying the new guy or what?

853
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:06,571
Nemoto speaking.

854
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:08,491
Hey are you even listening, old man?

855
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:12,411
Ah, all right, I'll be there right away.

856
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:16,581
Apparently Kyoshiro wants to do some light practice now.

857
00:59:16,581 --> 00:59:22,081
Of course there's no way you'll pitch,
but do you want to see us train?

858
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:28,841
That means, Kyoshiro's personal batting practice pitcher... Is you?

859
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:34,681
I'm really sorry Kyoshiro,

860
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:41,141
but would you mind showing the technique of a top-class
Major Leaguer to that big-headed Minor Leaguer?

861
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:46,021
He said he wanted to pitch against you and I'd
like to show him how ashamed he should feel.

862
00:59:46,021 --> 00:59:47,441
Yeah, it's fine.

863
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:54,571
It's my first batting practice this year, I'm not
sure I'll be able to show him anything special.

864
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:57,291
I'm sure you'll be all right.

865
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:00,211
<i>Hmm, yeah right, against the dull old man's pitch,</i>

866
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,631
<i>even if it's nice or crap, I'm not going to see anything.</i>

867
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:09,261
Let's start!

868
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,691
What's so amazing about that?

869
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:25,861
Everybody can hit a ball that slow.

870
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:29,321
When you said he was your exclusive practice pitcher
I imagined something mush more impressive,

871
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,781
but these are just pitches from a batting practice pitcher.

872
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:36,201
This is just a waste of time.

873
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:38,831
Wait, Shigeno.

874
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:41,871
You're making fun of Nemoto!

875
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:44,001
Go on, pitch!

876
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:47,501
There's no excuse for such words!

877
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:52,051
Just pitch. I'll prove your pitches are nothing compared to his.

878
01:00:58,391 --> 01:00:59,811
Hurry up and pitch!

879
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:04,021
Hey, wait a minute! I haven't had time to warm my shoulder up!

880
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:09,441
Fine, then take 10 balls to warm up. Nemoto
can always pitch after 10 warm up throws.

881
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:16,201
Well, let me tell you, I warm up my shoulder quickly, too.

882
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:22,701
Kyoshiro, it's not like you to let yourself
be tricked into a cheap fight like that.

883
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:27,881
A fight? No, this has nothing to do with a fight.

884
01:01:28,921 --> 01:01:33,971
It's just that I can't forgive his making fun of your work.

885
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:35,631
Kyoshiro.

886
01:01:38,051 --> 01:01:39,971
Okay, I'm good.

887
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:47,981
Well, before we begin shall we establish the rules?

888
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:49,271
Rules?

889
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:52,981
Let's make it a three turn at-bat.

890
01:01:52,981 --> 01:01:55,401
If you get one or more hits you win,

891
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:59,661
but if you don't get any hits after three at-bats,
you'll recommend me to the head coach.

892
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:02,991
Just one hit? You don't lack in self-confidence...

893
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:08,121
I don't mind. I would have done for even two
hits, but if you say so I guess it's fine.

894
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:11,961
Well, go on.

895
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:21,141
<i>Even for a first-class Major Leaguer, a well
controlled 100 mph fastball won't be so easy to hit!</i>

896
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:29,651
That's a pity, a line drive right back to the pitcher.

897
01:02:29,651 --> 01:02:31,441
That one counts as an out.

898
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:33,441
Next one, please.

899
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:39,571
<i>I can't believe it, that was low and inside almost
that looked out of the strike zone...</i>

900
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:41,821
<i>And in just one swing...</i>

901
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:46,451
Crap!

902
01:02:57,301 --> 01:03:03,221
That one was clearly over the left fielder, is there
something you don't understand, Shigeno?

903
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:06,811
You do not have the skills to make fun of Nemoto's pitches.

904
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:09,141
Maybe you didn't know...

905
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:15,231
But Nemoto mastered all sorts of pitches,
timing, and mixing of balls and strikes.

906
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:20,661
He manages to remind me of real game
situations while letting me hit comfortably.

907
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:26,331
Sure he can't throw 100 mph pitches, but he delivers lively pitches.

908
01:03:26,331 --> 01:03:29,621
Your pitches, however, have no life in them.

909
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:32,331
My pitches have no life?

910
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:36,091
I've stopped using machines for years.

911
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:41,431
The reason is that I realized it was useless to hit back such
lifeless balls no matter how many times I hit them.

912
01:03:41,841 --> 01:03:45,641
Yes, that's it, your pitches are exactly like
the lifeless balls from those machines.

913
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:49,391
No matter how much you raise your speed or aim at the corners.

914
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:53,271
Your pitches are just not scary at all!

915
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:13,104
Hey there.

916
01:04:13,104 --> 01:04:16,984
So I heard you got humiliated by Kyoshiro.

917
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:21,614
Oh shut up! It's not funny.

918
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:24,574
Don't worry about it so much.

919
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:28,424
Your opponent was Kyoshiro. Even amongst Major
Leaguers, he's one of the best batters.

920
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:30,594
Father...

921
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,874
Maybe I've finally reached the point where even
I have to learn how to throw breaking balls.

922
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:40,334
A breaking ball, huh?

923
01:04:40,674 --> 01:04:41,884
Yeah.

924
01:04:41,884 --> 01:04:48,134
Last year my goal in the Minors was to master
the control over my 150 km/h fastball.

925
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:54,314
And it worked; I was able to get my foot
in the Majors' doors. However...

926
01:04:55,984 --> 01:04:59,314
Against a Major Leaguer like Kyoshiro, it didn't work.

927
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:04,194
He said that even though my pitches are thrown at 150 km/h,
they're just like those delivered by a machine and aren't scary at all.

928
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:09,074
In reality, he easily crushed them with the sweet spot of his bat.

929
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:14,044
I disagree.

930
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:17,714
It's always the same with you; always rushing to an answer.

931
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:22,504
Kyoshiro is a batter with an average of
nearly .400 in the Majors, you know.

932
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:26,464
Don't you think it's a bit hasty to change your
style just because you got hit a little?

933
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,134
Besides...

934
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:32,804
If there was a breaking ball that you
could use, you'd already be using it.

935
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:39,604
<i>That's right; that's exactly the problem.</i>

936
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:47,654
<i>Even in the Majors I stressed and tried to use
breaking balls, but with no results to speak of.</i>

937
01:05:47,654 --> 01:05:53,124
<i>I also tried two-seam and four-seam fastballs, even a
cutter, because they're comparatively close to a fastball...</i>

938
01:05:53,124 --> 01:05:57,044
<i>But in terms of control and sharpness, they
were really far from being a usable weapon.</i>

939
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,504
<i>According to the coach's explanation...</i>

940
01:05:59,754 --> 01:06:05,094
<i>My fingertips remember the sensation of
throwing a fastball with a gyroscopic effect,</i>

941
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:08,514
<i>and that becomes a hindrance when I throw breaking balls.</i>

942
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:15,814
<i>That's why, if I want to learn anything, it'll have
to be either a forkball or a change-up.</i>

943
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:27,784
Damn!

944
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:33,534
When I pitched right-handed, I could throw change-ups.
Why is it so terrible with the left!

945
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:35,284
So this is where you are, Shigeno.

946
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:39,374
What are you doing? The control on that was just terrible.

947
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,124
N-Nothing!

948
01:06:41,754 --> 01:06:44,714
Well it doesn't matter, go to the main field.

949
01:06:45,174 --> 01:06:47,134
It looks like Itao is about to do some batting practice.

950
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:51,924
D-Does that mean I can throw against Itao?

951
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,014
Of course!

952
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:59,894
N-No, I'm fine you know, but it was so easy for Kyoshiro
to hit me. Right now, it'll just be the same with Itao.

953
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:01,274
Huh?!

954
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:05,444
What the hell are you talking about? You're
a batting practice pitcher, aren't you!?

955
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:07,574
It's your job to let them hit!

956
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:09,074
Now get going!

957
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,534
Shigeno.

958
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:15,414
Huh?

959
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:19,584
Your mistake was to try to hold down Kyoshiro right away.

960
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,624
A pitcher has things to learn from getting hit.

961
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:27,594
Try to think about that when you are Itao's batting practice pitcher.

962
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,684
Thank you.

963
01:07:40,684 --> 01:07:42,064
Nice batting!

964
01:07:46,154 --> 01:07:49,824
Oh, you're here Goro! Please replace me!

965
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:53,654
I'm not so young anymore; just 100 balls and I'm already...

966
01:08:04,544 --> 01:08:09,424
Hey! Don't start loosing your temper and trying to
shut him out with 150 km/h pitches, all right?

967
01:08:09,424 --> 01:08:12,174
It's his first session this year, you understand that?

968
01:08:12,174 --> 01:08:14,134
Heh, I know.

969
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:25,274
<i>Itao of the Titans...</i>

970
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:30,444
<i>Last year, I was just a spectator in the right field stands.</i>

971
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:31,944
<i>However...</i>

972
01:08:32,784 --> 01:08:37,154
<i>Now I'm in front of him on the same field, somehow.</i>

973
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:41,164
I'm fine with getting only fastballs. Could you spread them properly?

974
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:42,034
Yes, sir.

975
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:46,754
<i>A pitcher has things to learn from getting hit.</i>

976
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:51,594
<i>Try to think about that when you are Itao's batting practice pitcher.</i>

977
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,924
<i>Things to learn from getting hit?</i>

978
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:56,014
<i>What on Earth does that mean?</i>

979
01:09:04,354 --> 01:09:05,894
That's Itao, no doubt.

980
01:09:05,894 --> 01:09:07,984
He smashed it right out of the field on his first swing!

981
01:09:14,364 --> 01:09:20,114
<i>Damn! I hate this; not just throwing while saving
energy, but also getting hit like this.</i>

982
01:09:21,284 --> 01:09:25,294
<i>What is there to learn from that, old man?</i>

983
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:32,464
Was that in the zone?

984
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:35,054
Um yeah, just barely.

985
01:09:36,014 --> 01:09:37,634
<i>It was totally in.</i>

986
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,094
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

987
01:09:42,264 --> 01:09:44,514
<i>So that's what Nemoto was talking about.</i>

988
01:09:46,274 --> 01:09:50,444
<i>It is possible that Itao doesn't like pitches to the outside?</i>

989
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:54,274
<i>All right, one more.</i>

990
01:09:58,404 --> 01:10:00,904
<i>Of course, two in the same spot will get hit...</i>

991
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:03,574
<i>But, just now it was a pop fly to left field.</i>

992
01:10:04,584 --> 01:10:09,124
<i>All right, let's try throwing on even more extreme trajectories.</i>

993
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:22,644
<i>If you do your job as a batting practice pitcher, you get to
throw as many times as you like against top class batters.</i>

994
01:10:22,644 --> 01:10:24,684
<i>You can see their tendencies, their strengths, their weaknesses,</i>

995
01:10:25,104 --> 01:10:27,064
<i>and even their physical condition on that day.</i>

996
01:10:27,854 --> 01:10:30,854
<i>There's no other way to get that kind of opportunity, Shigeno.</i>

997
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,364
This is getting annoying, Shigeno.

998
01:10:39,494 --> 01:10:43,244
You've been pitching only extreme trajectories for a while and
I thought that explained why it was getting difficult to hit.

999
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:45,994
But aren't you increasing speed as well?

1000
01:10:47,084 --> 01:10:49,834
Huh? Is that so?

1001
01:10:49,834 --> 01:10:52,124
Well it doesn't matter, it's enough for today.

1002
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:57,004
I just wanted to do some light stretching today and suddenly
I have to worry about not letting you destroy my form.

1003
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:01,344
Itao!

1004
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:06,514
Now that we're both warmed up, what do you
say about getting serious for one at-bat?

1005
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:10,104
I'm sorry, Itao!

1006
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:12,734
Hey Goro, you're completely out of line!

1007
01:11:12,734 --> 01:11:14,774
For whom do you think this training is for--

1008
01:11:14,774 --> 01:11:18,824
Please bare with this to humor a young Triple A player.

1009
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:21,404
A minute, please.

1010
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:27,374
I heard from Coach Shigeno and Kyoshiro, too,
but I see you really are pushing your luck.

1011
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:33,164
However, dreaming about getting onto the national team so much
as to request an assignment of a batting practice pitcher here...

1012
01:11:33,754 --> 01:11:37,214
You're not only pushing your luck, you have guts.

1013
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:46,764
All right, if you want to test your strength so badly, you can join
the youth team, which arrives next week here in Okinawa.

1014
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,434
Huh, seriously?

1015
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:52,024
Ah, Coach Sasaki!

1016
01:11:52,024 --> 01:11:55,894
It's already been decided that the young members were taken from
12 different Japanese ball clubs, giving us two extra players.

1017
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:59,984
I don't mind, the youth team will have a lot of games to play.

1018
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:03,364
It's really not a problem if we get one or two more pitchers.

1019
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:08,574
This way you'll have your chance to face
Itao and Kyoshiro with all your strength.

1020
01:12:10,124 --> 01:12:13,164
Yeah! Thank you, boss!

1021
01:12:13,164 --> 01:12:17,544
But until then, you have to do your job as batting practice pitcher.

1022
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:21,174
Yeah I will, I will I won't start any more fights!

1023
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,424
Well now, I suppose I should have a look at the bullpen.

1024
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:29,474
Hey Shigeno, can you throw for me now?

1025
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,394
Uh, oh... Yes!

1026
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:35,484
Coach Sasaki, why did you do that?

1027
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:41,444
It's true, I did ask you to have a look at him once
if the chance presented itself during this camp.

1028
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:46,114
But to be taken care of this much is a more
generous treatment than what I asked for!

1029
01:12:46,614 --> 01:12:49,704
The mere fact that he's allowed to participate
in that camp is already quite enough.

1030
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,954
I'm not really granting you any special treatment.

1031
01:12:56,294 --> 01:12:58,254
See, Kyoshiro recommended him.

1032
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:02,344
He said ,"This one is interesting. How about we let
him join the youth team to see how it goes?"

1033
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:10,344
Apparently, his precious bat broke during a two-pitch duel.

1034
01:13:12,974 --> 01:13:16,734
It seems like a waste to leave him as a batting practice pitcher.

1035
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:23,614
Besides, there's no way we'll get our hands on
the World Cup just by using common sense.

1036
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:30,074
I can think of more drastic things to do.

1037
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:33,914
More drastic things?

1038
01:13:46,758 --> 01:13:50,348
<i>I see now... It's exactly like what that old man Nemoto was saying.</i>

1039
01:13:50,678 --> 01:13:57,018
<i>I feel as if I'm starting to get the hang of all the batters'
tendencies, their favorite spots and the trajectories they don't like.</i>

1040
01:13:57,438 --> 01:13:59,858
<i>But the problem remains...</i>

1041
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:15,328
Damn it! It's just no good!

1042
01:14:15,328 --> 01:14:19,498
My forkball doesn't fall at all. I have no control
whatsoever over my change-up...

1043
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,418
It'll never become something I can use.

1044
01:14:22,968 --> 01:14:25,218
<i>I really won't be able to throw them...</i>

1045
01:14:25,218 --> 01:14:29,008
<i>A former right-hander can't just start
throwing breaking balls with his left hand.</i>

1046
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:30,638
Sure.

1047
01:14:33,308 --> 01:14:36,268
That's the official catcher, Domoto.

1048
01:14:36,648 --> 01:14:38,648
Do you want to start with playing catch?

1049
01:14:38,648 --> 01:14:39,898
No, that's alright.

1050
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:43,318
You can crouch. I've already warmed
up my shoulder on the main field.

1051
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:46,108
That's...

1052
01:15:00,418 --> 01:15:03,008
Woah! They've already started!

1053
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:07,128
Hey! Let me join you!

1054
01:15:07,678 --> 01:15:09,178
Hey!

1055
01:15:10,098 --> 01:15:11,098
Goro!?

1056
01:15:14,728 --> 01:15:17,768
Katori is one of the starting pitchers for the Pheonix.

1057
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,608
Karasawa is the sixth batter for Chukyo.

1058
01:15:19,608 --> 01:15:22,648
And Yakushiji is the lead-off hitter for the Saitama Jackals.

1059
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:26,698
To be honest, I never thought Katori
and Karasawa would become pros.

1060
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:28,068
How cruel!

1061
01:15:28,068 --> 01:15:29,408
He's unbelievable.

1062
01:15:29,408 --> 01:15:31,618
I wonder if there's a limit to your indifference.

1063
01:15:31,618 --> 01:15:32,578
However...

1064
01:15:32,578 --> 01:15:36,248
Kusano, I see your defensive skills are well
appreciated since you're a starter on the Leopards.

1065
01:15:36,248 --> 01:15:37,408
Yeah, I guess.

1066
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:38,788
I'm here, too!

1067
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:44,588
If you hear about the ace relief pitcher for the
Arrows, that's me; Akutsu, the Knuckleball pitcher!

1068
01:15:47,298 --> 01:15:48,258
Who are you again?

1069
01:15:48,258 --> 01:15:51,678
It's me for crying out loud! Why did you only forget about me?!

1070
01:15:52,138 --> 01:15:56,848
Hello juniors, I will ask you not to stand
in the way of Sengoku Masato.

1071
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:07,318
When your upperclassman from Kaido, the best slugger in the
history of the Miyagi Grizzlies, is speaking, listen to him!

1072
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:12,158
I must say, I'm surprised to see you join us.

1073
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:16,448
You must have made a strong impression on Itao and Kyoshiro.

1074
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:21,538
Well, not exactly... Somehow Coach Sasaki picked me up.

1075
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,708
Coach Sasaki?

1076
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:25,838
Oh yeah, Toshi...

1077
01:16:25,838 --> 01:16:28,918
Can you come with me after we're finished here?

1078
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:35,558
Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your
efforts coming here to Okinawa.

1079
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:41,018
Individually, I think you came here to work out and train, mainly the
same way you've been at your respective teams' training camps.

1080
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:44,148
But tomorrow, your game will be
against the Japanese national team.

1081
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:48,108
So what I want you to do is really frame your
mind as if you are going to beat them.

1082
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:51,818
And now, Coach Sasaki has a serious announcement to make.

1083
01:16:51,818 --> 01:16:53,528
A serious announcement?

1084
01:16:53,698 --> 01:16:59,868
Gentlemen, in order to make history and build the team
that will conquer the world and take the first World Cup,

1085
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:05,538
I am going to get rid of all useless
preconceptions, big names and past achievements.

1086
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,798
I personally think it gets in the way.

1087
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:13,338
Moreover, if you win the practice game against
the Japanese national team tomorrow,

1088
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,678
Then you all will...

1089
01:17:14,678 --> 01:17:17,218
Be the core team to represent Japan.

1090
01:17:19,728 --> 01:17:21,638
If we win...

1091
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:23,228
Japanese national team...

1092
01:17:24,558 --> 01:17:25,898
Isn't that interesting?

1093
01:17:25,898 --> 01:17:27,818
Well, that's only natural.

1094
01:17:28,278 --> 01:17:33,488
That's Coach Sasaki for you. I can't help but
get excited after hearing something like that.

1095
01:17:33,488 --> 01:17:36,448
All right, let's do it!

1096
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:41,998
Their eyes seem to have lit up.

1097
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:46,708
That's a good thing. It wouldn't be interesting
if they didn't come at us seriously.

1098
01:17:49,088 --> 01:17:51,298
Huh, breaking balls?

1099
01:17:51,298 --> 01:17:56,718
Yeah, I learned the hard way that I've reached a point
where throwing only fastballs won't get me very far.

1100
01:17:57,178 --> 01:18:00,718
All I've been doing for the past week is
working on throwing breaking balls.

1101
01:18:02,018 --> 01:18:06,438
I'd like to see if it's something I'll be able to use
by trying it out against you in a one turn at-bat.

1102
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,408
<i>Goro throwing breaking balls?</i>

1103
01:18:16,408 --> 01:18:21,038
<i>Well, if he adds a breaking ball to his
fastball, he'll be unbeatable for sure.</i>

1104
01:18:21,038 --> 01:18:26,208
<i>If he's never thrown them until now, surely it's not because
he didn't want to, but because he simply couldn't.</i>

1105
01:18:27,038 --> 01:18:28,458
Here I come.

1106
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,958
<i>What sort of pitch does he have in mind?</i>

1107
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,878
<i>A fast slider with a hard break?</i>

1108
01:18:32,878 --> 01:18:35,798
<i>A slow curve or some sort of change-up?</i>

1109
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:43,428
<i>There isn't a pitch that you could master in one week
that I shouldn't be able to analyze and foul off.</i>

1110
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:48,688
That's one strike, right?

1111
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:51,648
Huh, was there any break on that one?

1112
01:18:52,188 --> 01:18:56,568
Come on, you know that was a fastball just now,
I told you I'd try in one full turn at-bat, didn't I?

1113
01:18:56,568 --> 01:18:58,488
Oh, so that's what you meant.

1114
01:18:58,908 --> 01:19:02,118
<i>That means he intends to use it as his out pitch.</i>

1115
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:12,588
Outside corner fastball... Well, it's a bit boring to hit.

1116
01:19:14,548 --> 01:19:17,468
<i>Knowing him, the decisive pitch will be the third one.</i>

1117
01:19:18,178 --> 01:19:20,218
<i>Here comes the breaking ball.</i>

1118
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:39,448
<i>That ball just now...</i>

1119
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:41,578
Was a forkball.

1120
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:43,028
Forkball?

1121
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:51,128
But Goro, when you were in high-school, you also threw
one, but it didn't drop that much nor was it that fast.

1122
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:55,378
How did it become like that with just one week of practice?

1123
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,048
Well, there's a guy here who taught me the basics.

1124
01:20:12,398 --> 01:20:13,858
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

1125
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:15,568
<i>That's really Suguro!</i>

1126
01:20:15,568 --> 01:20:21,158
<i>The Japanese pioneer in the Major League; the man who
fights with great will and determination on the mound.</i>

1127
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:27,658
Nice ball!

1128
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:39,048
May I help you? I can't focus on what I'm
doing if you're watching me so closely.

1129
01:20:39,048 --> 01:20:45,308
Oh, I'm sorry. I was hoping to get some insight on
the great Suguro's super famous deadly forkball.

1130
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:46,678
Forkball?

1131
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:50,888
I won't throw any today, I'm afraid. It's
my first warm-up session, you know.

1132
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:55,268
Well, I don't mind...

1133
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:59,608
But could you teach me some things on
the grip or point out a few tips later?

1134
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:02,108
The thing is, I'd like to learn how to throw breaking balls somehow.

1135
01:21:03,618 --> 01:21:06,278
If I remember correctly, you're Shigeno...

1136
01:21:06,948 --> 01:21:09,618
The closer for the Triple A Memphis Bats, right?

1137
01:21:10,538 --> 01:21:12,918
Oh yes, you're well informed.

1138
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:18,878
It's best if you don't throw forkballs if you're just
starting to learn how to throw breaking balls.

1139
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:25,258
The forkball requires a specific skill set, and
it's not a pitch that is easily mastered.

1140
01:21:25,258 --> 01:21:28,388
Besides, a breaking ball is quite
stressful on your shoulder and elbow.

1141
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:32,018
I've had to have surgery on both of them.

1142
01:21:32,018 --> 01:21:35,058
Besides, there aren't that many pitchers in America who throw it.

1143
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:41,568
Well, I don't really care about that.

1144
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:48,028
I'm sure you don't have any regrets
about throwing forkballs, do you?

1145
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:51,498
What the heck are they doing?

1146
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:53,668
Alright then, Shigeno.

1147
01:21:53,668 --> 01:21:56,998
With all your strength, try to grab the ball from my hand.

1148
01:21:57,588 --> 01:22:00,378
I just have to pull hard enough to get it out, right?

1149
01:22:00,378 --> 01:22:02,588
I don't understand the point of something so simple...

1150
01:22:05,638 --> 01:22:07,968
Huh? That's strange!

1151
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:09,468
Damn, what the...?

1152
01:22:09,468 --> 01:22:10,768
You won't get it.

1153
01:22:10,768 --> 01:22:16,398
To throw a good forkball you need your
fingers to have this kind of strength.

1154
01:22:17,188 --> 01:22:19,858
Here, try it out for yourself.

1155
01:22:19,858 --> 01:22:25,318
Personally, my grip is around 70 kg. I hear Sasamoto
a famous forkball pitcher, has a grip around 80 kg.

1156
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:29,988
In addition to that grip, you have to train your fingers before...

1157
01:22:32,578 --> 01:22:36,668
Shigeno... Your fingers sure have some pinching strength.

1158
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:43,918
I'm not sure about my pinching strength, but I have a
70 kg grip in my right hand and a 90 kg in my left hand.

1159
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:45,838
90 kg?

1160
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:50,138
Now that I think of it, it's not that surprising that I can do this.

1161
01:22:50,468 --> 01:22:54,808
I broke my shoulder a while back, and I changed
from pitching right-handed to left-handed.

1162
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:58,058
At that time, I was training my left hand like a madman.

1163
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:04,988
Hey Suguro! If we're not going to do
anything, I'll go to batting practice.

1164
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:10,408
All right, I'll help you. You should be
able to learn how to throw a forkball.

1165
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:15,248
No, not only that. You might be able
to throw better forkballs than me.

1166
01:23:17,578 --> 01:23:21,418
And since then, Suguro has been teaching me the basics.

1167
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:28,718
I see. So that forkball just now was
a result from training with Suguro.

1168
01:23:28,718 --> 01:23:33,138
Nope. He did teach me the basics, but that wasn't Suguro's forkball.

1169
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:35,768
That was a gyro-fork!

1170
01:23:36,848 --> 01:23:38,728
Gyro... Fork

1171
01:23:38,728 --> 01:23:40,938
I made up the name just for fun.

1172
01:23:40,938 --> 01:23:44,068
If all my attempts to throw a forkball up till now were failures...

1173
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:48,148
It's because I was using my arm and wrist
differently from my normal pitching form.

1174
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:56,078
But with the gyro-fork, I can throw using
the same pitching form I normally use.

1175
01:24:05,798 --> 01:24:12,298
Oh yeah. Luckily, the one you saw before went well, but
I'm still just getting one out of two to stay on course.

1176
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:16,308
Obviously, a catcher can't catch it like this.
So far now, I can't use it during a game.

1177
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:18,688
N-No...

1178
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:22,108
That's amazing, With such a great break,

1179
01:24:22,108 --> 01:24:26,228
I'm sure any batter will swing, even if the pitch is a ball.

1180
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,398
You can use it, Goro!

1181
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:31,948
Huh? No, the control is so...

1182
01:24:31,948 --> 01:24:35,368
Even if you get some wild pitches, as long
as the catcher can stop them, it'll be find!

1183
01:24:35,368 --> 01:24:36,828
I'll catch them!

1184
01:24:37,788 --> 01:24:39,038
Toshi...

1185
01:24:39,038 --> 01:24:41,498
We'll win the game tomorrow...

1186
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:43,998
With your gyro-fork!

1187
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:48,258
Can you still pitch today?

1188
01:24:48,258 --> 01:24:50,088
Of course, I'm not tired at all!

1189
01:24:50,088 --> 01:24:52,218
Alright, then let's practice some more.

1190
01:24:52,218 --> 01:24:54,098
All right!

1191
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:06,580
When I said that the winner of this match would become
the main representatives of Japan, it wasn't a lie.

1192
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:12,910
If we lose here against the Young team, winning and advancing in
games against the world would just be a dream among dreams.

1193
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:17,830
I won't bother you and talk strategy. I only have one thing to say:

1194
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,370
Let's give Japan's greatest weapon,

1195
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:25,290
Editor's Note: Small ball is the strategy of using bunts, stolen bases, and singles to
advance the runner and score runs without relying on extra-base hits or home runs.

1196
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,210
small ball...

1197
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,290
A thorough polishing!

1198
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,340
Yes!

1199
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,840
Looks like they don't plan on going easy on us.

1200
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:31,880
Yeah.

1201
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,180
Of course.

1202
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,850
It's an earnest match.

1203
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:37,010
Yeah, let's win!

1204
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,350
Let's win and earn the right to challenge the world!

1205
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,440
Play ball!

1206
01:25:51,407 --> 01:25:51,563
Strike!

1207
01:25:51,407 --> 01:25:52,230
Strike!

1208
01:25:52,287 --> 01:25:56,747
Wow, what a pitcher! That was an amazing pitch!

1209
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:02,297
G-Goro, don't tell me you've never heard of Harada?

1210
01:26:03,507 --> 01:26:05,977
Starting off with Japan's ace...

1211
01:26:06,297 --> 01:26:07,387
Naturally...

1212
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:10,057
After all, they also want to check to see how well-prepared they are.

1213
01:26:12,427 --> 01:26:13,727
Strike!

1214
01:26:16,397 --> 01:26:18,017
<i>The difference in strength is evident,</i>

1215
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:23,027
<i>but if we manage to play our own style
of baseball, we'll have a chance.</i>

1216
01:26:25,577 --> 01:26:26,657
A safety bunt!

1217
01:26:31,827 --> 01:26:33,037
Safe!

1218
01:26:34,747 --> 01:26:37,207
Well done, Kusano!

1219
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:39,667
Second batter, third baseman, Yakushiji.

1220
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:40,877
Push on, Yakushiji!

1221
01:26:44,087 --> 01:26:45,717
<i>So it's Yakushiji.</i>

1222
01:26:46,337 --> 01:26:49,177
<i>Harada's decisive slider is a tough one...</i>

1223
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:52,717
<i>If I take a pitch, I'll be down in the count,</i>

1224
01:26:53,347 --> 01:26:55,387
<i>but the runner is Kusano, who has fast legs.</i>

1225
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:57,807
<i>So instead of going with a safe strategy,</i>

1226
01:26:57,807 --> 01:26:59,187
<i>I'll bet on his legs...</i>

1227
01:26:59,517 --> 01:27:00,897
<i>And be active!</i>

1228
01:27:02,977 --> 01:27:04,187
Hit-and-run!?

1229
01:27:08,737 --> 01:27:09,527
Out!

1230
01:27:11,027 --> 01:27:13,697
Damn... It snuck up on me, eh?

1231
01:27:13,697 --> 01:27:15,417
Don't mind, don't mind!

1232
01:27:15,617 --> 01:27:18,167
One out and a runner on second. We have a chance!

1233
01:27:18,707 --> 01:27:23,337
Third batter, first base, Karasawa.

1234
01:27:27,297 --> 01:27:28,137
Ball!

1235
01:27:30,347 --> 01:27:33,387
<i>Harada's known to have some difficulties when he starts pitching.</i>

1236
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:37,347
<i>Is it having to deal with runners on his
back that makes him impatient?</i>

1237
01:27:41,107 --> 01:27:41,727
Ball!

1238
01:27:42,517 --> 01:27:43,107
Ball!

1239
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:45,487
Foul!

1240
01:27:47,397 --> 01:27:48,907
Ball! Ball four!

1241
01:27:50,657 --> 01:27:52,827
One out with runners on first and second, huh?

1242
01:27:52,827 --> 01:27:53,787
Leave it to me.

1243
01:27:54,737 --> 01:28:01,247
With 28 home runs last year, the greatest slugger
in the history of the Miyagi Grizzlies...

1244
01:28:01,917 --> 01:28:04,877
The fourth batter, Sengoku Masato, will decide it all.

1245
01:28:04,957 --> 01:28:09,507
Uh... I'm sorry, but Sengoku, you're the fifth batter.

1246
01:28:12,097 --> 01:28:15,177
Go for it, Toshi! Get the runners home for us!

1247
01:28:16,017 --> 01:28:17,517
<i>A chance in the first inning.</i>

1248
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:22,477
<i>If we can grab even one run here, we'll
be able to take control of the game!</i>

1249
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:25,897
Nice one!

1250
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:39,367
Out!

1251
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:47,837
What an arm!

1252
01:28:49,587 --> 01:28:52,427
Leading off the bottom of the first inning for the All Japan team,

1253
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,057
the first batter and right fielder, Kyoshiro.

1254
01:28:55,427 --> 01:28:57,177
Come on, Katori!

1255
01:28:57,177 --> 01:28:59,977
"Japanese representative" means nothing! Just shut them out!

1256
01:29:00,767 --> 01:29:02,767
<i>"Just shut them out," huh?</i>

1257
01:29:08,237 --> 01:29:09,237
<i>Yeah...</i>

1258
01:29:09,947 --> 01:29:11,147
<i>Let's do that!</i>

1259
01:29:12,777 --> 01:29:13,697
Strike!

1260
01:29:14,567 --> 01:29:15,947
<i>Good, it's cutting well.</i>

1261
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:19,907
Strike two!

1262
01:29:20,207 --> 01:29:22,167
Yes! We've got this!

1263
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:26,247
Hey, hey! Just because there are two strikes doesn't mean
you can let your guard down around the opponent.

1264
01:29:26,547 --> 01:29:27,587
What are you saying?

1265
01:29:27,587 --> 01:29:31,717
Don't forget that with the count to his favor,
Katori has his high-speed slider.

1266
01:29:32,297 --> 01:29:37,927
And I know full well, that it's not a pitch
you can hit on your first time at bat.

1267
01:29:38,717 --> 01:29:39,767
<i>It's strange.</i>

1268
01:29:40,927 --> 01:29:45,267
<i>Kyoshiro is more of the type that swings
on the first pitch if it's in the zone.</i>

1269
01:29:46,567 --> 01:29:47,857
<i>Here I go!</i>

1270
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:54,357
W-What?

1271
01:29:59,447 --> 01:30:02,617
<i>Was he waiting... For the high-speed slider?</i>

1272
01:30:03,417 --> 01:30:04,457
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

1273
01:30:05,077 --> 01:30:08,417
<i>My high-speed slider... With just one pitch?</i>

1274
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:11,547
Second batter, second baseman, Taniguchi.

1275
01:30:12,717 --> 01:30:13,927
<i>That was a fluke!</i>

1276
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:16,467
<i>That was definitely a fluke!</i>

1277
01:30:17,677 --> 01:30:18,557
He took off!

1278
01:30:24,057 --> 01:30:26,147
<i>He completely read the pitcher's motion.</i>

1279
01:30:30,357 --> 01:30:31,477
<i>That was clever.</i>

1280
01:30:36,357 --> 01:30:39,327
<i>How many times do you think I'm going to let you do that!?</i>

1281
01:30:42,077 --> 01:30:42,907
Safe!

1282
01:30:45,997 --> 01:30:47,497
<i>And I was on the lookout...</i>

1283
01:30:47,497 --> 01:30:48,917
<i>What a runner!</i>

1284
01:30:50,627 --> 01:30:53,667
What's the battery doing? Get a grip!

1285
01:30:55,877 --> 01:30:59,257
<i>Calm down! It's not as if the run has already been given up.</i>

1286
01:31:00,307 --> 01:31:03,477
<i>I'll hold them off from now on, so there's no problem...</i>

1287
01:31:04,177 --> 01:31:06,437
<i>Using my high-speed slider!</i>

1288
01:31:07,847 --> 01:31:08,607
<i>Easy!</i>

1289
01:31:15,197 --> 01:31:17,027
Good! We have the lead!

1290
01:31:30,037 --> 01:31:32,457
<i>My pitching isn't working.</i>

1291
01:31:35,797 --> 01:31:36,837
<i>Katori...</i>

1292
01:31:37,007 --> 01:31:40,547
Shit! He's completely caught up in the moment.

1293
01:31:41,177 --> 01:31:44,057
Don't mind, don't mind! It's only four runs!

1294
01:31:44,767 --> 01:31:46,057
It's already over.

1295
01:31:46,637 --> 01:31:48,807
Huh? What's over?

1296
01:31:48,807 --> 01:31:53,727
He's completely overwhelmed by the aura of
the Japanese team. He can't pitch normally.

1297
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:58,763
And for a batter, there's no easier prey than a scared pitcher.

1298
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:59,527
And for a batter, there's no easier prey than a scared pitcher.

1299
01:31:59,527 --> 01:32:01,157
Remember that, junior.

1300
01:32:01,157 --> 01:32:01,265
Is this the right time to talk about that?

1301
01:32:01,157 --> 01:32:03,407
Is this the right time to talk about that?

1302
01:32:03,407 --> 01:32:06,157
You're on the same team, so the least
you could do is encourage him!

1303
01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:07,327
What?

1304
01:32:07,327 --> 01:32:11,787
As usual, you're ignoring the proper way to address your elders, kid!

1305
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:15,707
Don't call me a kid! There's only a year's difference
in age between you and me, old man!

1306
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,587
Come on, stop it! The game is still going on!

1307
01:32:19,337 --> 01:32:22,347
Akutsu, go to the bullpen and warm up your arm.

1308
01:32:22,347 --> 01:32:24,467
Ah... Y-Yes!

1309
01:32:26,134 --> 01:32:28,474
As I though, they're one step above us.

1310
01:32:28,894 --> 01:32:32,474
Was it too much for rookies to face the Japanese representatives?

1311
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:34,894
Give it all you've got!

1312
01:32:34,894 --> 01:32:38,524
But if it starts to look bad, give up the mound to me right away!

1313
01:32:38,524 --> 01:32:41,614
Shut up! Don't say that, even if you're joking!

1314
01:32:42,367 --> 01:32:43,947
<i>Katori is a good pitcher.</i>

1315
01:32:44,617 --> 01:32:47,697
<i>The nine victories he gained as a rookie
last year were the real thing.</i>

1316
01:32:48,957 --> 01:32:51,207
<i>If his pitching got thrown out of rhythm...</i>

1317
01:32:53,037 --> 01:32:54,837
<i>It's because of that slider that got hit.</i>

1318
01:32:54,837 --> 01:33:00,427
<i>By hitting the pitch Katori was most confident in,
he crushed any chance Katori might've had.</i>

1319
01:33:00,717 --> 01:33:05,007
<i>And with the way he ran through us, he
completely snatched the flow of the game.</i>

1320
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:07,967
Ball! Ball four!

1321
01:33:08,387 --> 01:33:09,177
<i>Shit!</i>

1322
01:33:12,897 --> 01:33:14,357
Good, good.

1323
01:33:15,227 --> 01:33:20,067
<i>In spite of his four-run lead, he won't relax
or ask for anything but small plays.</i>

1324
01:33:20,897 --> 01:33:22,907
<i>So this is Coach Sasaki's baseball?</i>

1325
01:33:23,617 --> 01:33:27,787
<i>Damn! I want to get onto that mound and fight!</i>

1326
01:33:28,907 --> 01:33:30,867
Ball! Ball four!

1327
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,537
One out and bases loaded, huh?

1328
01:33:36,497 --> 01:33:39,507
I'm sorry. I aimed too much for the corner.

1329
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:43,377
Don't worry. This game has only just begun.

1330
01:33:43,677 --> 01:33:46,927
Le'ts just concentrate on preventing the next run.

1331
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:50,557
Yeah, it's just four runs. We'll get you double that.

1332
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:53,057
All right.

1333
01:33:54,307 --> 01:33:56,687
Ninth batter, shortstop, Yamazaki.

1334
01:34:07,487 --> 01:34:09,117
Second! You still have time!

1335
01:34:10,947 --> 01:34:11,867
Out!

1336
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:16,957
We're not out of it yet! It's just the beginning!

1337
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:20,377
Coming back from a four-run deficit is easy!

1338
01:34:25,007 --> 01:34:26,757
Strike! Batter out!

1339
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:33,557
That pitcher's completely revved up.

1340
01:34:34,097 --> 01:34:36,807
Yeah, even though they're stronger individually,

1341
01:34:36,807 --> 01:34:41,227
I thought there'd be gaps we could take advantage
of in their lack of cohesion early in the game.

1342
01:34:41,227 --> 01:34:42,437
But it looks like it won't be that simple.

1343
01:34:42,987 --> 01:34:43,897
I agree.

1344
01:34:44,607 --> 01:34:46,987
And they still have a lot of spare energy.

1345
01:34:47,567 --> 01:34:53,037
Ignoring that last offensive, it feels like their
entire team is moving around as one.

1346
01:34:53,537 --> 01:34:56,747
Coach Sasaki's aim: small ball, eh?

1347
01:34:56,747 --> 01:34:58,997
It just means it has matured that much.

1348
01:35:00,877 --> 01:35:02,297
This is a strong team.

1349
01:35:03,087 --> 01:35:04,917
It looks like it could become a tough game.

1350
01:35:05,297 --> 01:35:06,337
Toshi...

1351
01:35:06,337 --> 01:35:10,257
Don't tell me you've already given up.

1352
01:35:10,887 --> 01:35:11,847
Of course not!

1353
01:35:12,597 --> 01:35:14,887
I'm just mentioning how much it's worth playing!

1354
01:35:18,937 --> 01:35:23,397
For Young Japan, replacing the pitcher Katori for Akutsu.

1355
01:35:23,569 --> 01:35:24,529
Coach!

1356
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:28,069
I'm going to warm up in the bullpen.

1357
01:35:28,069 --> 01:35:31,319
Whenever it starts looking risky, please call me out!

1358
01:35:31,949 --> 01:35:32,779
Sure...

1359
01:35:35,574 --> 01:35:39,744
Now that I'm here, we're not going to give up any more runs!

1360
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:42,914
First batter, right fielder, Kyoshiro.

1361
01:35:43,624 --> 01:35:48,134
You better hold him off nice and proper. Giving
up any more runs will make it really tough.

1362
01:35:48,504 --> 01:35:50,804
Like I'd let him hit that easily!

1363
01:36:04,944 --> 01:36:07,024
A knuckleball on the first pitch...

1364
01:36:07,904 --> 01:36:12,074
<i>Don't think of small ball as baseball that utilizes small tricks.</i>

1365
01:36:12,074 --> 01:36:15,244
<i>If you see an opportunity, it's about going all-out after it.</i>

1366
01:36:15,784 --> 01:36:20,124
<i>The small ball strategy is to play impeccable baseball.</i>

1367
01:36:27,549 --> 01:36:31,339
What the heck is he doing, throwing such a careless pitch.

1368
01:36:40,812 --> 01:36:43,562
<i>I'm the relief pitcher for the Arrows!</i>

1369
01:36:44,022 --> 01:36:47,982
<i>Why am I intiminated by the title "Japanese representative"?</i>

1370
01:36:50,442 --> 01:36:52,072
Ball! Ball four!

1371
01:36:52,782 --> 01:36:54,492
<i>I-It's no good.</i>

1372
01:36:55,282 --> 01:36:57,122
<i>Don't force it, Akutsu.</i>

1373
01:36:57,372 --> 01:36:58,952
<i>Shit!</i>

1374
01:37:17,342 --> 01:37:19,972
First batter, right fielder, Kyoshiro.

1375
01:37:21,012 --> 01:37:25,482
One out and the bases loaded. Akutsu
just isn't good enough today, is he?

1376
01:37:25,482 --> 01:37:26,982
This is as far as it goes.

1377
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:28,772
Umpire!

1378
01:37:32,822 --> 01:37:33,822
<i>Who will it be?</i>

1379
01:37:34,692 --> 01:37:38,702
For Young Japan, replacing the pitcher Akutsu,

1380
01:37:40,582 --> 01:37:41,662
Shigeno.

1381
01:37:42,162 --> 01:37:44,042
All right, let's go!

1382
01:37:44,372 --> 01:37:46,002
G-Goro?

1383
01:37:46,462 --> 01:37:49,422
Oh, so he's already been allowed to come out.

1384
01:37:50,462 --> 01:37:54,172
Is this the rookie you taught to throw forkballs, Suguro?

1385
01:37:54,512 --> 01:37:58,182
Yeah. But I really just gave him a few pointers, you know.

1386
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:03,472
You're here earlier than I thought you'd be.

1387
01:38:03,812 --> 01:38:06,982
Yeah. Everything worked out like I hoped.

1388
01:38:07,602 --> 01:38:12,192
I'll just retire Kyoshiro and shut out the Japanese national team.

1389
01:38:12,192 --> 01:38:16,942
You take care of that lead with come-from-behind
home runs until we win this game in style.

1390
01:38:17,822 --> 01:38:20,782
That's how we're going to get onto the representative team...

1391
01:38:21,412 --> 01:38:25,332
And next, we fire up our engines and go to the World Cup, Toshi!

1392
01:38:29,212 --> 01:38:30,082
Yeah!

1393
01:38:35,462 --> 01:38:43,552
<i>It's been two weeks since I pointed out that lifeless pitch, and
it looks like you've been experimenting with a few things.</i>

1394
01:38:47,642 --> 01:38:50,732
<i>Now let's see the answer that you came up with.</i>

1395
01:38:51,232 --> 01:38:52,112
Play!

1396
01:38:53,112 --> 01:38:54,572
<i>Please, Shigeno...</i>

1397
01:38:55,232 --> 01:38:56,982
<i>Change the flow of the game...</i>

1398
01:38:57,492 --> 01:39:00,202
<i>Otherwise, we'll look like untalented fools.</i>

1399
01:39:16,712 --> 01:39:17,842
Strike!

1400
01:39:19,762 --> 01:39:21,842
Hmm... That was fast.

1401
01:39:23,302 --> 01:39:25,262
Starting with a pitch outside of the zone.

1402
01:39:25,972 --> 01:39:28,392
Looks like he's done some studying.

1403
01:39:33,692 --> 01:39:34,612
Foul!

1404
01:39:36,982 --> 01:39:41,532
<i>His pitches are moving a lot more than two
weeks ago when his arm wasn't warmed up.</i>

1405
01:39:43,032 --> 01:39:47,662
<i>This was the exact same trajectory as before, but
I couldn't make perfect contact in one swing...</i>

1406
01:39:48,592 --> 01:39:51,712
<i>Well then... How will you come with the next one?</i>

1407
01:39:52,622 --> 01:39:54,712
<i>Good, we've trapped him.</i>

1408
01:40:01,132 --> 01:40:02,302
<i>Shigeno...</i>

1409
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:04,642
<i>Will you throw it here?</i>

1410
01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:11,102
<i>Here comes my new weapon, the gyrofork!</i>

1411
01:40:17,272 --> 01:40:18,022
Great!

1412
01:40:28,162 --> 01:40:29,162
Sorry, sorry!

1413
01:40:30,122 --> 01:40:32,422
The control isn't there yet, is it?

1414
01:40:34,252 --> 01:40:38,632
<i>Shit! We trained so much yesterday
and that's all the control I have!?</i>

1415
01:40:39,132 --> 01:40:41,802
<i>With the bases full, the fork is just too risky.</i>

1416
01:40:45,222 --> 01:40:47,182
<i>A forkball, Goro!</i>

1417
01:40:47,722 --> 01:40:49,432
<i>That was just a mistake.</i>

1418
01:40:49,932 --> 01:40:54,102
<i>If it's the same as yesterday's practice, you
should get one on-target every other pitch.</i>

1419
01:40:54,692 --> 01:40:58,442
<i>With three pitches to work with, if only one goes on-target,</i>

1420
01:40:58,442 --> 01:41:00,572
<i>I'm sure Kyoshiro will swing and miss.</i>

1421
01:41:01,192 --> 01:41:04,112
<i>So don't be afraid of throwing wild
pitches, and throw it as hard as you can!</i>

1422
01:41:12,082 --> 01:41:12,832
<i>Here it comes!</i>

1423
01:41:17,422 --> 01:41:18,212
Foul!

1424
01:41:20,922 --> 01:41:22,672
Wasn't that a forkball?

1425
01:41:22,672 --> 01:41:27,052
Y-Yeah... When did he learn how to throw such a forkball?

1426
01:41:28,762 --> 01:41:32,272
<i>Impossible! How could he even touch that forkball?</i>

1427
01:41:32,812 --> 01:41:35,572
<i>Is Kyoshiro's bat control that good?</i>

1428
01:41:36,272 --> 01:41:38,352
<i>Anyway, another forkball.</i>

1429
01:41:39,112 --> 01:41:41,912
<i>Going head-on with the national team
with only fastballs is too difficult.</i>

1430
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:45,072
<i>If we can take Kyoshiro down with a forkball...</i>

1431
01:41:45,402 --> 01:41:48,952
<i>I'll make the batters focus more on that
and make your fastball more dangerous.</i>

1432
01:41:54,542 --> 01:41:55,502
<i>He...</i>

1433
01:41:55,962 --> 01:41:57,002
<i>He saw through it!</i>

1434
01:41:58,582 --> 01:42:00,212
It's not good enough yet.

1435
01:42:00,212 --> 01:42:03,212
With control like that, he shouldn't even use it.

1436
01:42:03,672 --> 01:42:06,632
No, that's not the only problem...

1437
01:42:07,882 --> 01:42:11,182
<i>His forkball has a fatal flaw.</i>

1438
01:42:14,102 --> 01:42:15,022
Ball!

1439
01:42:17,732 --> 01:42:19,732
<i>So this is your answer?</i>

1440
01:42:20,652 --> 01:42:22,572
<i>I'm disappointed.</i>

1441
01:42:23,272 --> 01:42:26,532
<i>I see it now. It's the timing of the break.</i>

1442
01:42:27,572 --> 01:42:31,532
<i>It starts to drop too soon, so the batter
has time to realize it's a forkball.</i>

1443
01:42:32,782 --> 01:42:36,372
<i>We didn't have time to correct that during practice yesterday.</i>

1444
01:42:37,462 --> 01:42:38,912
<i>It's too risky, Toshi.</i>

1445
01:42:38,912 --> 01:42:43,252
<i>The forkball is no good anymore, so let's
drop it and fight with my fastball.</i>

1446
01:42:44,802 --> 01:42:46,762
<i>W-What?!</i>

1447
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,552
<i>A forkball!</i>

1448
01:42:49,302 --> 01:42:53,182
<i>Kyoshiro already knows that you can't throw anything but fastballs.</i>

1449
01:42:53,642 --> 01:42:58,642
<i>But it's better to risk walking in a run than getting a big hit.</i>

1450
01:43:28,092 --> 01:43:28,852
Damn!

1451
01:43:29,052 --> 01:43:30,132
Goro!

1452
01:43:31,802 --> 01:43:35,562
You got hit on your fastball. I won't start
complaining and saying I told you so...

1453
01:43:36,312 --> 01:43:40,942
But tell me one thing. Do you trust in my lead or not?

1454
01:43:41,352 --> 01:43:44,862
Talk about a load of crap!

1455
01:43:45,692 --> 01:43:51,532
I never thought that you had so little faith in my fastball.

1456
01:43:56,082 --> 01:43:58,702
Batting second, second baseman, Taniguchi.

1457
01:44:01,582 --> 01:44:02,502
<i>What was that about?</i>

1458
01:44:03,122 --> 01:44:06,212
<i>You're the one who wanted to throw forkballs.</i>

1459
01:44:06,962 --> 01:44:10,632
<i>I'm only doing this because you said that
your fastball wouldn't be enough.</i>

1460
01:44:11,882 --> 01:44:13,852
<i>Well for the time being, we have one
out and runners on second and third.</i>

1461
01:44:14,302 --> 01:44:18,602
<i>So let's go with a low and inside fastball to avoid a sacrifice fly.</i>

1462
01:44:30,032 --> 01:44:31,112
Strike!

1463
01:44:31,492 --> 01:44:33,202
<i>T-The opposite side?!</i>

1464
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,100
Ball!

1465
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,990
<i>A-Again, to the side opposite my glove.</i>

1466
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,540
<i>I see... So it's like that, huh?</i>

1467
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:13,830
<i>You bastard.</i>

1468
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,800
<i>Well then, throw it wherever you'd like!</i>

1469
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:22,130
<i>You never thought a catcher was any better than a wall, anyway.</i>

1470
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:32,900
Strike!

1471
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,650
Huh?!

1472
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,450
T-Time!

1473
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:47,030
What an interesting play!

1474
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:49,150
Are you all right?

1475
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,700
W-Where the hell were you throwing the ball!?

1476
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,080
Sorry, I didn't grip the ball right, and it slipped.

1477
01:45:56,710 --> 01:46:00,370
And who would've thought he'd get a jump start against a lefty?

1478
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:01,970
What?!

1479
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:04,750
Maybe you should've attempted to pick him off.

1480
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:09,640
Even if I had thrown that ball accurately,
he probably would have been safe.

1481
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:13,200
So you're saying everything is my fault now?

1482
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,160
Huh? No, I didn't mean to say it like that!

1483
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:19,960
In fact, Toshi, you hit me on purpose, didn't you!?

1484
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:22,620
Hey! What're you guys doing?

1485
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:25,340
Anyway, first is open.

1486
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:29,210
We should walk Taniguchi to get to the next batter.

1487
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:33,300
I agree. It'll be easier to defend with the bases loaded.

1488
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:37,680
If it goes well, we might be able to get a double
play and finish without Itao coming to bat.

1489
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,220
I disagree!

1490
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:45,630
What's the point of playing a bases-loaded
strategy in a game where we're already behind?

1491
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,900
That's exactly my point!

1492
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:51,680
Whatever, Toshiya. You've always been a coward!

1493
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:55,890
You and your probabilities! You can't do
anything but pitch around the batter!

1494
01:46:56,620 --> 01:47:01,040
Y-You're the one who's so crude you can't see anything beyond that!

1495
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:05,920
Aren't you the one who gave up a hit by
ignoring my signs in the first place?

1496
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:06,880
What did you say?!

1497
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:09,670
Will you two cut it out?! We're in the middle of a game!

1498
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,590
You're taking too long!

1499
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:15,370
If the place that got hit is fine, then let's continue!

1500
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,930
Y-Yes!

1501
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:22,270
Sato...

1502
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:31,610
When two childhood friends become pros and form a
battery, their pride is bound to clash at some point.

1503
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:37,320
However...

1504
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:42,540
You're probably the person who knows Shigeno best.

1505
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,380
If you can't get him to give you his best, who will?

1506
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,760
Play!

1507
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:00,180
I never thought you had such little faith in my fastball.

1508
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:06,140
<i>He's right. I was so preoccupied with making him
use the forkball that I forgot about his strengths.</i>

1509
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:09,060
<i>What? We're facing him?</i>

1510
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:15,820
<i>Knowing that you're easily swayed by your feelings,</i>

1511
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:21,370
<i>getting you in a good mood by letting you throw
your fastball is the first thing I need to do.</i>

1512
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,370
Strike! Batter out!

1513
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:30,840
Nice ball!

1514
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:40,140
Damn, that last ball was fast. I was a little worried
about it being a forkball and swung too late.

1515
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:43,640
So he came with a fastball because
he can't use his forkball effectively.

1516
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:47,560
But isn't it a little absurd to come at us with just a fastball?

1517
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:50,020
Wouldn't it be best to substitute him out?

1518
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:56,610
<i>When I told him that his pitches had no life to them,</i>

1519
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:59,820
<i>I didn't mean for him to try to learn breaking balls.</i>

1520
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:04,700
<i>It's true that I hit his fastball easily earlier this spring...</i>

1521
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:10,830
<i>And against the fastball he delivered in this
confusion, it wasn't hard to get a base hit...</i>

1522
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,090
<i>But I still feel...</i>

1523
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:15,170
<i>Somewhat frustrated?</i>

1524
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:16,420
<i>In the end, it was just a single.</i>

1525
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:19,930
Strike!

1526
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,950
<i>There aren't any pitchers who can
work in Triple A... With only a fastball.</i>

1527
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:29,600
<i>Although we can get hits, it's not easy to get a home run...</i>

1528
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:32,560
<i>Against that powerful fastball of yours.</i>

1529
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,280
<i>And that's exactly why I recommended
that you be included in this game.</i>

1530
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,870
Strike!

1531
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,420
<i>Before relying on something like that hastily-modified
forkball, the first thing you should realized...</i>

1532
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:57,840
<i>Is that you've been overestimating the control that
you've polished so much, and stop relying on it.</i>

1533
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,930
Foul! Foul!

1534
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,640
Damn, so close!

1535
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:10,600
Seriously?

1536
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:14,310
That pitch was low and on the outside corner!

1537
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:15,940
T-Time!

1538
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:22,410
Goro, did you put everything you had
on that last pitch to strike him out?

1539
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,450
Yeah, I don't need to waste pitches.

1540
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:28,910
I'm confident in my control.

1541
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:32,620
What is it?

1542
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:34,500
Goro...

1543
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:37,880
I won't ask for a forkball anymore.

1544
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:41,720
Your fastball is enough, but could
you throw it where I put my glove?

1545
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:51,140
I believe in your fastball, so could you trust in my lead just a little?

1546
01:50:57,570 --> 01:50:58,650
All right.

1547
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:15,130
<i>It was never Goro's style to waste pitches...</i>

1548
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:19,670
<i>But he didn't have the control that he has now.</i>

1549
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:22,760
<i>There were the occasional balls, and he even hit a few batters...</i>

1550
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:26,930
<i>As a result, those did the job of wasted pitches.</i>

1551
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:37,190
<i>A pitcher that doesn't do these things intentionally
will never be feared, no matter how fast he is.</i>

1552
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,400
Ball!

1553
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,870
<i>That's why I told you wasting pitches is useless.</i>

1554
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,700
<i>He's the cleanup batter of their team!</i>

1555
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,830
<i>The low and away pitch just now was hit
because Yamanaka had nothing to fear.</i>

1556
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:03,090
<i>Since your control was already acknowledged
and seen extensively during batting practice,</i>

1557
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:05,380
<i>he had no reason to back off.</i>

1558
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:13,060
<i>If we don't get rid of that docile perception
of you, we won't be able to hold them back.</i>

1559
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:25,900
<i>We have to brush him back with a pitch that's high and inside, Goro.</i>

1560
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:31,160
Editor's Note: A brushback pitch is a high and inside fastball used to back
the batter off the plate and make him afraid to stand close to the plate.

1561
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:31,790
<i>If we don't use these kinds of tactics, then we won't be able
to take these top-class batters out with only your fastball.</i>

1562
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:40,670
Ball!

1563
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,220
<i>That's not good enough! Such an easily-dodged
brushback pitch isn't effective!</i>

1564
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:50,930
<i>A batter of his caliber won't even blink an eye
against a brushback pitch of that level.</i>

1565
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:58,650
Hey, is Sato asking for a brushback pitch
even though he's just a rookie?

1566
01:52:58,650 --> 01:53:02,860
That's pretty dirty. What'll he do if someone gets hurt?

1567
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:05,820
<i>Just one more; doesn't matter if it's a ball.</i>

1568
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:09,240
<i>I just want you to scare him enough to make him step back!</i>

1569
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:15,870
Shit!

1570
01:53:27,545 --> 01:53:29,385
Dead ball!

1571
01:53:36,605 --> 01:53:39,975
A-Are you all right, Yamanaka?

1572
01:53:39,975 --> 01:53:42,605
How dare you ask me that, you bastard!

1573
01:53:42,605 --> 01:53:44,985
You kept asking for high and inside pitches!

1574
01:53:45,405 --> 01:53:46,735
Uh, well...

1575
01:53:54,285 --> 01:53:56,785
I never told you to hit him!

1576
01:53:56,785 --> 01:54:01,375
Besides, it's not a brushback pitch if it's below the hips.

1577
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:03,875
Toshi...

1578
01:54:03,875 --> 01:54:08,885
Are you really asking me to throw such a
dangerous pitch knowing what I've been through?

1579
01:54:19,395 --> 01:54:20,815
S-Sorry.

1580
01:54:20,815 --> 01:54:25,025
B-But I just thought you overcame that fear.

1581
01:54:25,895 --> 01:54:27,485
Of course I did.

1582
01:54:27,485 --> 01:54:32,865
I wouldn't have become a pitcher if I was
afraid of throwing above a batter's chest,

1583
01:54:32,865 --> 01:54:38,375
but I've never resorted to throwing a brushback pitch
near the head of a batter just to scare them.

1584
01:54:38,375 --> 01:54:39,745
Not once!

1585
01:54:40,745 --> 01:54:45,965
If I had to resort to this to get someone out,
I would have given up pitching a long time ago.

1586
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:49,715
Even Gibson made a mistake...

1587
01:54:50,005 --> 01:54:52,965
And that was just a really unfortunate accident.

1588
01:54:52,965 --> 01:54:56,935
There's just no way that I can do
something like that knowing what I know.

1589
01:55:02,185 --> 01:55:03,225
I'm sorry.

1590
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:06,735
It was a bit insensitive of me,

1591
01:55:06,735 --> 01:55:10,195
but what are we suppose to do next?

1592
01:55:10,735 --> 01:55:12,235
The forkball is no good either.

1593
01:55:12,235 --> 01:55:15,195
How do you intend to hold the Japanese representatives back?

1594
01:55:17,455 --> 01:55:20,995
Maybe it was just too soon for us.

1595
01:55:23,205 --> 01:55:25,045
Using a forkball learned overnight...

1596
01:55:25,505 --> 01:55:29,795
And a mixture of pitches, wasn't going to hold
down the top Japanese professionals.

1597
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:32,965
The representatives aren't that easy, after all.

1598
01:55:33,555 --> 01:55:34,805
Goro...

1599
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:39,685
Batting fourth: left fielder, Itao.

1600
01:55:46,735 --> 01:55:47,605
But still...

1601
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:51,105
That doesn't mean we should give up.

1602
01:55:51,905 --> 01:55:58,035
Let's end all these unrealistic plans we had of trying to
impress the coaches to get onto the national team...

1603
01:55:58,615 --> 01:56:02,125
We'll just be the rookies we are and go all out to show them all!

1604
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:04,455
Yeah!

1605
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:11,215
Play!

1606
01:56:16,885 --> 01:56:19,345
<i>Too bad, Minor Leaguer.</i>

1607
01:56:19,845 --> 01:56:22,265
<i>You have the spirit of a true challenger,</i>

1608
01:56:22,265 --> 01:56:25,435
<i>but your pitches aren't ready to cross swords with the world's.</i>

1609
01:56:26,685 --> 01:56:28,485
<i>Low and inside! I've got you now!</i>

1610
01:56:35,365 --> 01:56:36,235
Foul!

1611
01:56:40,615 --> 01:56:42,995
That ball just now had power!

1612
01:56:42,995 --> 01:56:44,825
So he's serious now?

1613
01:56:45,585 --> 01:56:47,165
How did he...

1614
01:56:53,255 --> 01:56:54,385
<i>Outside?</i>

1615
01:56:59,675 --> 01:57:00,765
Foul!

1616
01:57:06,105 --> 01:57:11,775
<i>That's it! He stopped caring and something inside him changed!</i>

1617
01:57:14,315 --> 01:57:16,065
<i>What's up with him?</i>

1618
01:57:16,065 --> 01:57:20,495
<i>Didn't he learn anything from what Kyoshiro or I tried to teach him?</i>

1619
01:57:21,365 --> 01:57:28,915
<i>But with the pitch he has, it looks like all the advice we gave
him were just small tricks to him. I gotta admit, he's got guts.</i>

1620
01:57:30,915 --> 01:57:33,585
<i>I never thought you'd break two of my bats.</i>

1621
01:57:35,675 --> 01:57:37,045
<i>But...</i>

1622
01:57:37,045 --> 01:57:41,425
<i>There's no way I'm letting a young Minor Leaguer take me out.</i>

1623
01:57:45,595 --> 01:57:47,355
<i>Down the middle? Don't underestimate me!</i>

1624
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,630
So you're really going home?

1625
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:25,010
You did notify the manager and the coaches, right?

1626
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,560
Yeah.

1627
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,310
And next week, spring training camps for the Majors start anyway.

1628
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:34,440
Now that I know that I'm not skilled enough yet,
there's not much point in me staying in Okinawa.

1629
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:43,200
Well, I did find a few things to focus on,
so I'll try to improve on them one by one.

1630
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:48,160
I have to work on that forkball if I want
to be able to follow your lead.

1631
01:58:53,746 --> 01:58:55,046
What!?

1632
01:58:55,046 --> 01:58:58,006
Goro packed his bags and left?

1633
01:58:58,336 --> 01:59:04,766
Yeah. He said, "Thank you again for your
time. It seems that I still lack training."

1634
01:59:04,766 --> 01:59:07,686
He's more humble than I thought.

1635
01:59:08,306 --> 01:59:13,646
T-That little brat. Again, without a word to his father...

1636
01:59:14,186 --> 01:59:18,736
That loud-mouthed Minor Leaguer ran
away with his tail between his legs.

1637
01:59:18,736 --> 01:59:21,816
He was only inches away from being knocked out yesterday.

1638
01:59:22,486 --> 01:59:24,696
Is that what it looked like to you?

1639
01:59:25,736 --> 01:59:26,946
Itao?

1640
01:59:29,786 --> 01:59:33,286
The only hit we got was that single from Kyoshiro.

1641
01:59:33,836 --> 01:59:34,996
As for me...

1642
01:59:38,086 --> 01:59:41,756
I had three bats broken and a long fly ball to center.

1643
01:59:42,656 --> 01:59:46,236
No, in any other stadium that one would've been gone.

1644
01:59:46,656 --> 01:59:51,396
To hit it that far without hitting it off the
core of the bat; that's Itao for you!

1645
01:59:53,936 --> 01:59:56,316
<i>Without hitting it off the core?</i>

1646
01:59:58,146 --> 02:00:01,736
<i>There's no doubt that the third pitch hit dead on.</i>

1647
02:00:05,905 --> 02:00:07,495
Oh, no...

1648
02:00:07,495 --> 02:00:11,245
I thought it was only a sore throat, but it turned out to be a fever.

1649
02:00:11,865 --> 02:00:13,415
This is the worst.

1650
02:00:13,835 --> 02:00:18,375
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and the key person is in Okinawa.

1651
02:00:18,755 --> 02:00:20,755
He hasn't even bothered to send me a text message.

1652
02:00:24,385 --> 02:00:30,015
Mom, I think I caught a cold. Can you make
me some rice soup or something?

1653
02:00:32,895 --> 02:00:35,515
{\an8}Note: We will come home tomorrow morning. Please eat your meals together with Taiga, all right? Mom and Dad

1654
02:00:35,515 --> 02:00:41,855
Oh, that's right. She said they were going to the hot springs today.

1655
02:00:44,065 --> 02:00:46,115
There's nothing in here...

1656
02:00:48,905 --> 02:00:51,905
And Taiga won't be home until tonight.

1657
02:00:51,905 --> 02:00:55,205
There's nothing I can do. The best thing
to do is probably to go back to bed.

1658
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:03,965
Ah! And now I have the chills!

1659
02:01:06,295 --> 02:01:07,345
Yes?

1660
02:01:11,015 --> 02:01:12,475
Y-Yes?

1661
02:01:14,975 --> 02:01:15,895
Honda!?

1662
02:01:16,355 --> 02:01:18,475
What the heck are you doing?

1663
02:01:19,065 --> 02:01:24,405
I'm surprised you're here! What happened with the camp?

1664
02:01:24,735 --> 02:01:27,485
Well, I went all out, but in the end,

1665
02:01:27,485 --> 02:01:29,285
it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.

1666
02:01:29,825 --> 02:01:34,995
Now I know that I'm not good enough
to be on the national team yet.

1667
02:01:35,575 --> 02:01:37,875
That's why I left the camp.

1668
02:01:38,455 --> 02:01:40,165
I... I see.

1669
02:01:40,795 --> 02:01:43,585
Besides, spring training for the Majors starts next week.

1670
02:01:44,175 --> 02:01:48,005
To minimize jet lag, I was thinking of
leaving Japan the day after tomorrow.

1671
02:01:48,385 --> 02:01:50,465
T-The day after tomorrow!?

1672
02:01:50,805 --> 02:01:52,135
Y-Yeah...

1673
02:01:52,135 --> 02:01:58,055
That's why I came to spend some time with you
today, but you had to go and catch a cold.

1674
02:02:01,435 --> 02:02:06,275
S-So I guess you shouldn't stay here too long.

1675
02:02:06,275 --> 02:02:09,735
It'd be terrible if you caught my cold
just before going back to America.

1676
02:02:11,785 --> 02:02:13,495
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1677
02:02:14,615 --> 02:02:16,165
It's really too risky.

1678
02:02:16,165 --> 02:02:17,915
Well then, I'm off.

1679
02:02:19,085 --> 02:02:20,495
Take care!

1680
02:02:23,295 --> 02:02:25,085
You cold-hearted rat!

1681
02:02:35,095 --> 02:02:37,595
Woah, it's still rising.

1682
02:02:38,435 --> 02:02:45,525
Well, I did suggest that he should go, but I didn't
mean that he should leave so quickly.

1683
02:02:46,235 --> 02:02:49,945
And we won't see each other for a while once he's back in America.

1684
02:02:51,575 --> 02:02:56,405
Does he really love me?

1685
02:02:59,705 --> 02:03:00,915
Taiga?

1686
02:03:01,705 --> 02:03:03,165
Hey, Shimizu!

1687
02:03:03,455 --> 02:03:04,875
H-Honda!?

1688
02:03:04,875 --> 02:03:08,085
Here you go. I bought you some fruit and other stuff.

1689
02:03:31,065 --> 02:03:32,445
Hon-da?

1690
02:03:35,075 --> 02:03:38,035
I must have dozed off!

1691
02:03:38,325 --> 02:03:39,415
Thank you.

1692
02:03:39,865 --> 02:03:41,395
I feel much better.

1693
02:03:41,745 --> 02:03:43,915
I think my temperature went down,

1694
02:03:44,335 --> 02:03:48,465
and I'd feel bad if you caught my cold, so you should go now.

1695
02:03:55,215 --> 02:04:02,725
Nope, your fever hasn't gone down at all.
I'll stay with you until Taiga comes home.

1696
02:04:03,305 --> 02:04:07,775
Don't worry about me. I don't catch colds easily.

1697
02:04:08,945 --> 02:04:10,855
I'll go change that towel.

1698
02:04:11,775 --> 02:04:13,545
I'm telling you it's fine!

1699
02:04:15,735 --> 02:04:20,035
You know we can only be together for this little while.

1700
02:04:22,915 --> 02:04:24,165
H-Honda!

1701
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:30,525
What are you doing? Get back to bed!

1702
02:04:31,005 --> 02:04:32,925
I-It's decided!

1703
02:04:33,255 --> 02:04:35,755
I'm going to America!

1704
02:04:37,635 --> 02:04:40,265
WHAT?!

1705
02:04:43,204 --> 02:04:46,664
Please, Mom! Please say yes!

1706
02:04:46,804 --> 02:04:51,934
No! It's far too dangerous for a young
woman to go to America alone.

1707
02:04:51,934 --> 02:04:57,404
I'll be fine! I know someone there, so I won't be alone!

1708
02:04:57,654 --> 02:04:58,904
You know someone?

1709
02:04:58,904 --> 02:05:00,484
Oh, I get it!

1710
02:05:00,484 --> 02:05:03,574
You want to go there to see Shigeno!

1711
02:05:05,204 --> 02:05:07,914
<i>He had to say something...</i>

1712
02:05:07,914 --> 02:05:10,624
Shigeno? What's this about Shigeno?

1713
02:05:11,454 --> 02:05:14,624
Oh, you didn't know, Mom?

1714
02:05:14,964 --> 02:05:19,924
Those two have already started down
the path of a serious relationship.

1715
02:05:20,504 --> 02:05:23,914
Don't use that tone of voice to make it sound so dirty!

1716
02:05:25,344 --> 02:05:29,764
Come to think of it... Isn't Shigeno trying
to become a Major Leaguer in America?

1717
02:05:31,014 --> 02:05:31,974
Yeah...

1718
02:05:33,224 --> 02:05:38,734
Since he's trying really hard over there,
I wanted to go and give him my support.

1719
02:05:40,734 --> 02:05:44,324
Well, there won't be any problems if she's with him, Mom,

1720
02:05:44,744 --> 02:05:49,104
but I don't think Dad would be too happy if
you told him that she's going to see a guy.

1721
02:05:52,954 --> 02:05:54,624
I guess it can't be helped, then.

1722
02:05:54,624 --> 02:05:55,204
Eh?

1723
02:05:55,364 --> 02:05:58,584
I'll just tell your dad that you're going with a friend.

1724
02:05:59,044 --> 02:06:01,574
Just make sure you don't cause any trouble for Shigeno.

1725
02:06:03,744 --> 02:06:05,494
Thank you, Mom!

1726
02:06:14,699 --> 02:06:20,219
<i>In America, renting a car is supposed to
be safe and give you the most mobility,</i>

1727
02:06:20,709 --> 02:06:23,659
<i>and I got my driver's license a year ago, but...</i>

1728
02:06:23,879 --> 02:06:27,879
Editor's Note: A paper driver is someone who has a driver's license, but outside
of taking the exam, they have no experience driving on a day-to-day basis.

1729
02:06:23,879 --> 02:06:27,879
<i>I'm a total paper driver!</i>

1730
02:06:36,679 --> 02:06:38,349
I'm worn out.

1731
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:44,349
But I did drive a long way since I left the airport
in Miami, so only a little more to go, eh?

1732
02:06:44,349 --> 02:06:47,939
Traveling overseas alone is actually
easier than I thought it would be!

1733
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:50,399
All right, then! Let's go!

1734
02:07:11,589 --> 02:07:13,509
N-No way!

1735
02:07:13,509 --> 02:07:18,309
Why is the engine not starting!? Is the battery dead!?

1736
02:07:31,109 --> 02:07:35,239
What should I do? I could laugh at how deserted it is...

1737
02:07:40,789 --> 02:07:41,579
Excuse me!

1738
02:07:42,159 --> 02:07:42,869
<i>Wait, no.</i>

1739
02:07:43,289 --> 02:07:49,249
<i>Who knows what would happen to a cute girl
like me if I got picked up by a total stranger!</i>

1740
02:07:57,049 --> 02:08:02,639
All right! If it's like this, all I can do is to walk
to a place where there's bound to be a phone!

1741
02:08:17,569 --> 02:08:21,329
Maybe I should have gone in the other direction.

1742
02:08:21,789 --> 02:08:26,749
I've been walking for over an hour, and
there's still nothing to be seen!

1743
02:08:27,209 --> 02:08:32,709
And the sun's also setting. This is like a really bad joke.

1744
02:08:37,129 --> 02:08:41,429
Please let there be something on the other side of this hill.

1745
02:09:03,369 --> 02:09:05,289
Yes! Yes!

1746
02:09:06,539 --> 02:09:08,169
<i>Thank God!</i>

1747
02:09:08,829 --> 02:09:14,919
<i>I knew you couldn't be that cruel to a poor girl
like me who just arrived in a foreign country.</i>

1748
02:09:21,349 --> 02:09:22,509
I can't believe it...

1749
02:09:23,469 --> 02:09:24,509
It's over...

1750
02:09:24,969 --> 02:09:29,229
I'll just waste away just like this abandoned hotel.

1751
02:09:41,909 --> 02:09:43,409
Help! Help!

1752
02:09:43,409 --> 02:09:47,159
Please don't hurt me and let me live!

1753
02:09:49,919 --> 02:09:52,709
Hey! Hey, Shimizu!

1754
02:09:54,879 --> 02:09:57,259
What the heck are you doing here?

1755
02:10:00,299 --> 02:10:02,259
H-Honda?

1756
02:10:02,259 --> 02:10:04,389
What happened to your car?

1757
02:10:05,009 --> 02:10:06,769
I-It broke down.

1758
02:10:08,019 --> 02:10:10,889
But what're you doing here?

1759
02:10:11,269 --> 02:10:17,479
You said you'd be arriving around five, but it was getting late,
so we decided to look for you on the road you'd probably take.

1760
02:10:19,109 --> 02:10:20,359
Come on, get up.

1761
02:10:25,489 --> 02:10:29,909
You're late! What would you have done if someone attacked me!?

1762
02:10:29,909 --> 02:10:33,499
No, I was never worried about that.

1763
02:10:33,499 --> 02:10:35,339
How dare you!

1764
02:10:41,219 --> 02:10:43,219
It should work now. Try to start the engine.

1765
02:10:43,759 --> 02:10:45,639
He says to try and start the engine.

1766
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:53,769
Wow, it started!

1767
02:10:53,769 --> 02:10:54,649
Thank you!

1768
02:10:54,649 --> 02:10:57,229
Thank you, Mister... Uh...?

1769
02:10:58,069 --> 02:10:59,069
Keane.

1770
02:10:59,069 --> 02:11:00,709
Thanks for doing this, Keane.

1771
02:11:01,069 --> 02:11:02,239
Don't mention it.

1772
02:11:02,569 --> 02:11:06,369
He's not really a friendly person... Is he a teammate?

1773
02:11:06,369 --> 02:11:11,499
Yes. It's his off-season now, but he already has a
contract in the Majors and is a full-time starter.

1774
02:11:13,329 --> 02:11:17,089
Man, I really thought it was the end of me!

1775
02:11:17,669 --> 02:11:23,179
No matter how far I walked, there were no
stores, and then it started to get dark.

1776
02:11:23,179 --> 02:11:25,549
You're a nuisance right from the start, eh?

1777
02:11:25,549 --> 02:11:27,929
I didn't come here for a vacation, you know.

1778
02:11:30,219 --> 02:11:32,809
H-Honda, have you had dinner yet?

1779
02:11:32,809 --> 02:11:36,149
How could I with all the trouble you've caused?

1780
02:11:36,149 --> 02:11:38,819
I have a game tomorrow, and I'm very busy,

1781
02:11:38,819 --> 02:11:41,029
so could you hurry up and get me back to the dorm?

1782
02:11:41,649 --> 02:11:44,489
Will you stop nagging already!?

1783
02:11:44,489 --> 02:11:47,029
It's not my fault the battery died!

1784
02:11:47,029 --> 02:11:51,789
Besides, when your girlfriend comes
all the way to America to see you,

1785
02:11:51,789 --> 02:11:53,659
shouldn't you be at least a little happy?

1786
02:11:54,789 --> 02:11:57,039
Shimizu! Keep your eyes on the road!

1787
02:12:01,129 --> 02:12:04,549
Oh my God!

1788
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:13,099
Wow!

1789
02:12:13,929 --> 02:12:17,479
You have a great place, you can see the ocean from here!

1790
02:12:19,899 --> 02:12:22,069
Oh! Excuse my intrusion!

1791
02:12:27,029 --> 02:12:28,989
And now to add this...

1792
02:12:36,669 --> 02:12:37,869
Honda, Honda.

1793
02:12:38,749 --> 02:12:39,499
Yeah?

1794
02:12:39,499 --> 02:12:43,459
It's almost ready. I'm sure it's been a while
since you've had a Japanese meal, right?

1795
02:12:43,459 --> 02:12:44,799
You must be looking forward to it.

1796
02:12:47,299 --> 02:12:49,589
Is curry really a Japanese meal?

1797
02:12:49,589 --> 02:12:51,559
If you start complaining, I won't let you have any!

1798
02:12:52,099 --> 02:12:53,469
Fine, fine...

1799
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:56,479
Curry?!

1800
02:12:59,189 --> 02:13:00,729
Here you go!

1801
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,109
Hmm?

1802
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:08,359
That's strange...

1803
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:09,869
Bon appétit!

1804
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:13,199
What're you doing, Honda?

1805
02:13:14,489 --> 02:13:16,329
You didn't leave any apples uncut!

1806
02:13:16,329 --> 02:13:17,789
Why would I do that!?

1807
02:13:19,079 --> 02:13:21,379
Well, what do you think?

1808
02:13:21,749 --> 02:13:23,799
Do you think you can make it in the Majors?

1809
02:13:23,799 --> 02:13:29,839
Hmm... It's hard to say, but for now, I've been lucky
enough not to have been sent back to the Minors.

1810
02:13:30,469 --> 02:13:31,509
I see...

1811
02:13:32,759 --> 02:13:33,889
Oh, right!

1812
02:13:34,219 --> 02:13:36,269
Here's the phone number for this place.

1813
02:13:36,769 --> 02:13:39,269
Give me a call when you've checked
in and gotten settled at your hotel.

1814
02:13:39,269 --> 02:13:42,479
Hotel? Oh, right. I didn't tell you...

1815
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:49,569
I spent almost everything I had on renting a car,
so I was hoping that you'd let me crash here...

1816
02:13:50,489 --> 02:13:52,409
Huh!?

1817
02:13:52,409 --> 02:13:56,539
No, no, I refuse! I'm not going anywhere!

1818
02:13:56,489 --> 02:14:01,539
It won't work! There are plenty of cheap
motels around here, so leave already!

1819
02:14:01,539 --> 02:14:06,049
What's the big deal? I'll sleep on the couch
and I won't cause any problems!

1820
02:14:06,049 --> 02:14:07,629
Don't you know how expensive hotels are?

1821
02:14:07,629 --> 02:14:08,839
Cut it out already!

1822
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:12,679
H-Honda?

1823
02:14:12,969 --> 02:14:16,259
I told you that I'm not here on vacation.

1824
02:14:16,259 --> 02:14:19,309
So far, I've only been used for middle relief, but
tomorrow they're trying me out as a starter.

1825
02:14:19,729 --> 02:14:21,769
It really is an important day for me.

1826
02:14:22,599 --> 02:14:25,979
This dorm was completely full at the beginning of spring training,

1827
02:14:25,979 --> 02:14:29,689
but now it's almost empty since over half of
the occupants were sent back to the Minors.

1828
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:34,819
The same goes for me, too. If I give up hits
tomorrow, I won't be able to stay here, either.

1829
02:14:34,819 --> 02:14:39,199
Everyone here is in the middle of a
fight to claim a spot in the Majors,

1830
02:14:39,959 --> 02:14:43,789
and none of them have their girlfriends with them! None of them!

1831
02:14:57,969 --> 02:14:58,849
I'm sorry.

1832
02:15:00,479 --> 02:15:04,599
I knew you were in the middle of a difficult challenge, but...

1833
02:15:04,599 --> 02:15:07,859
It's just that when you came back from
Okinawa, you left right away for America.

1834
02:15:07,859 --> 02:15:10,069
And you don't call me very often, either.

1835
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:16,199
It's like you're not letting me get closer, to the
point when you're always looking for a fight.

1836
02:15:19,909 --> 02:15:21,749
I knew I was being selfish...

1837
02:15:22,869 --> 02:15:24,289
I knew, but...

1838
02:15:25,459 --> 02:15:29,459
I couldn't just do nothing and wait another year!

1839
02:15:29,459 --> 02:15:31,129
I'm not that strong!

1840
02:15:44,269 --> 02:15:45,689
Shimizu!

1841
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:55,409
I'm sorry.

1842
02:15:55,909 --> 02:15:58,369
I was giving you the could shoulder.

1843
02:16:02,119 --> 02:16:05,539
You may think this is funny because it sounds old-fashioned,

1844
02:16:05,959 --> 02:16:10,379
but I think that a man and woman shouldn't take the
idea of spending a night under the same roof lightly.

1845
02:16:11,629 --> 02:16:17,139
With a person whom I really love, it's
something I don't want to take lightly.

1846
02:16:21,929 --> 02:16:23,349
I'm really sorry.

1847
02:16:24,179 --> 02:16:26,939
I understand. It's all right.

1848
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:36,449
I'm relieved.

1849
02:16:45,082 --> 02:16:46,452
Oh, no!

1850
02:16:46,452 --> 02:16:49,792
I can't believe it's two o'clock! I overslept because of the jet lag!

1851
02:16:49,962 --> 02:16:53,592
Ah! He said he would be the starting pitcher today!

1852
02:17:01,632 --> 02:17:02,342
Eh?

1853
02:17:02,892 --> 02:17:04,302
That's not Honda.

1854
02:17:05,352 --> 02:17:06,562
What does that mean?

1855
02:17:07,972 --> 02:17:10,812
<i>Huh, he's already given up six runs!?</i>

1856
02:17:10,812 --> 02:17:13,022
<i>Maybe they took him out...</i>

1857
02:17:13,942 --> 02:17:14,942
Out!

1858
02:17:16,152 --> 02:17:17,612
<i>That must be it...</i>

1859
02:17:17,612 --> 02:17:21,032
<i>I guess even for Honda, getting to the Majors isn't easy.</i>

1860
02:17:21,612 --> 02:17:25,412
Hey, Shigeno! We're counting on your
sharp pitching for this inning, too!

1861
02:17:27,792 --> 02:17:29,372
<i>Shigeno?</i>

1862
02:17:32,372 --> 02:17:34,582
Ah, I got it wrong!

1863
02:17:35,002 --> 02:17:38,052
<i>That's right! He plays for the Hornets!</i>

1864
02:17:38,052 --> 02:17:40,842
<i>On top of that, he has a no-hitter going into the fifth!</i>

1865
02:17:49,222 --> 02:17:50,522
Strike out!

1866
02:17:50,852 --> 02:17:53,692
Great, Shigeno!

1867
02:18:01,032 --> 02:18:03,862
Six innings and no hits! That's amazing!

1868
02:18:03,862 --> 02:18:06,372
But why'd they take you out?

1869
02:18:06,372 --> 02:18:08,582
I was hoping for a perfect game.

1870
02:18:08,582 --> 02:18:13,372
Well, it was just an exhibition game, so it
wouldn't have meant anything, anyway.

1871
02:18:13,372 --> 02:18:14,872
Anyway, that's good enough, right?

1872
02:18:14,872 --> 02:18:17,292
With that, your promotion is almost certain, right?

1873
02:18:17,292 --> 02:18:19,252
Not exactly...

1874
02:18:19,252 --> 02:18:21,882
Today's opponents were poor at batting,

1875
02:18:22,302 --> 02:18:24,632
so it's important to get good results in the next game.

1876
02:18:27,222 --> 02:18:29,392
But I'm relieved!

1877
02:18:29,722 --> 02:18:32,352
At least I didn't get demoted to the Minors with you watching.

1878
02:18:32,732 --> 02:18:34,392
That would have been too lame.

1879
02:18:36,602 --> 02:18:39,982
By the way, tomorrow we have a day off, so I have free time.

1880
02:18:39,982 --> 02:18:41,902
Do you want to go somewhere?

1881
02:18:41,902 --> 02:18:43,402
Yes, let's!

1882
02:18:47,782 --> 02:18:49,992
Ah! That was refreshing!

1883
02:18:49,992 --> 02:18:51,122
Hello?

1884
02:18:51,122 --> 02:18:53,412
Shigeno? It's Stacey.

1885
02:18:53,412 --> 02:18:54,292
Boss!

1886
02:18:54,752 --> 02:18:57,292
I'm sorry to call so late, but it's an emergency.

1887
02:18:57,292 --> 02:19:00,752
I need you to pack your things tonight and
take the next flight to Los Angeles.

1888
02:19:01,172 --> 02:19:04,922
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone your
promotion to the Majors for now.

1889
02:19:04,922 --> 02:19:08,642
D-Does that mean you're sending me to a Minor League camp, Boss?

1890
02:19:09,602 --> 02:19:10,722
Of course not!

1891
02:19:10,722 --> 02:19:15,602
How could I justify sending a guy who just
pitched six perfect innings back to the Minors?

1892
02:19:15,602 --> 02:19:18,062
Don't worry. It's not a Minor League camp.

1893
02:19:18,232 --> 02:19:20,062
Well then why do I have to go to LA?

1894
02:19:20,062 --> 02:19:21,732
Have I been traded or something?

1895
02:19:21,732 --> 02:19:26,652
You'll find out when you get there. I'm
sure it'll be a great experience for you.

1896
02:19:40,002 --> 02:19:42,002
We've arrived, sir.

1897
02:19:51,472 --> 02:19:54,602
Isn't this just a Minor League stadium?

1898
02:19:55,312 --> 02:19:57,522
What's so good about this place?

1899
02:19:58,352 --> 02:19:59,732
Here you are!

1900
02:20:00,482 --> 02:20:02,232
It's been a while, Goro.

1901
02:20:03,022 --> 02:20:06,692
F-Father! What are you doing here?

1902
02:20:06,692 --> 02:20:09,362
What? What do you mean "What?"

1903
02:20:09,362 --> 02:20:10,952
Wasn't it obvious once you saw this?

1904
02:20:12,332 --> 02:20:14,412
No, I don't understand...

1905
02:20:14,412 --> 02:20:17,502
Sheesh! Can't you watch the news once in a while?

1906
02:20:17,832 --> 02:20:22,672
The Japanese team advanced past the first round
of the Asian preliminaries in first place,

1907
02:20:23,002 --> 02:20:26,632
so we're here for the second round, which takes place here.

1908
02:20:26,632 --> 02:20:29,882
S-So what am I doing here?

1909
02:20:29,882 --> 02:20:31,142
You're going to love this, Goro!

1910
02:20:31,592 --> 02:20:34,102
You've been selected for the Japanese national team!

1911
02:20:34,102 --> 02:20:37,062
You're going to replace Suguro, who retired after getting injured.

1912
02:20:37,772 --> 02:20:40,602
W-What!?
